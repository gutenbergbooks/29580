<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>
<h3>THE RIM AND WHAT LAY BENEATH IT</h3>
</div>
<p>Not all of the West is tamed and trained to run
smoothly on pneumatic tires and to talk
more enthusiastically of the different &#8220;makes&#8221;
of cars than of bits and saddles. There are still
wide stretches unknown of tourists and movie men hunting
locations for Western melodrama where
men live in the full flavor of adventure and romance
and never know it, because they have never
known any other way to live.</p>
<p>In the Black Rim country there is such a place,&ndash;&ndash;a
wide, rough, sage-grown expanse where cattle
and horses and sheep scarce know the look of
barbed wire, and where brands are still the sole
mark of ownership. Set down between high mountain
ranges, remote, sufficient unto itself, rudely
prosperous, the Black Rim country has yet to be
tamed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></div>
<p>Black Rim country is called bad. The men from
Black Rim are eyed askance when they burr their
spur rowels down the plank sidewalks of whatever
little town they may choose to visit. A town
dweller will not quarrel with one of them. He will
treat him politely, straightway seek some acquaintance
whom he wishes to impress, and jerk
a thumb toward the departing Black Rim man, and
say importantly: &#8220;See that feller I was talking
with just now? That&#8217;s one of them boys from the
Black Rim. Man, he&#8217;d kill yuh quick as look at
yuh! He&#8217;s bad. Yep. You want to walk &#8217;way
round them birds from the Rim country. They&#8217;re
a hard-boiled bunch up that way.&#8221; And he would
be as nearly correct in his estimate as such men
usually are.</p>
<p>Tom Lorrigan&#8217;s father used to carry a rifle
across his thighs when he rode up the trail past
Devil&#8217;s Tooth Ridge to the benchland beyond,
where his cattle fed on the sweet bunch grass. He
never would sit close to a camp-fire at night save
when his back was against a huge boulder and he
could keep the glare of the fire from his eyes.
Indians he killed as he killed rattlers, on the range
theory that if they did not get him then they
might some other time, and that every dead Indian
counted one less to beware of. Tom Lorrigan&#8217;s
father was called a bad man even in Black Rim
country,&ndash;&ndash;which meant a good deal. Hard-bitted
men of the Black Rim chose their words wisely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
when they spoke to Tom&#8217;s father; chose wisely
their words when they spoke of him, unless they
had full faith in the listener&#8217;s loyalty and discretion.</p>
<p>Tom Lorrigan&#8217;s father lived to be sixty,&ndash;&ndash;chiefly
because he was &#8220;quick on the draw&#8221; and
because he never missed anything that he shot at.
But at sixty, when he was still hated by many,
loved by a very few and feared by every one, he
died,&ndash;&ndash;crushed under his horse when it fell on
the Devil&#8217;s Tooth trail one sleety day in midwinter.</p>
<p>Young Tom Lorrigan learned to shoot when he
learned to ride, and he was riding pitching horses
before he could be certain which was p and which
was q in his dad&#8217;s old spelling book. Which does
not by any means prove that young Tom was an
ignoramus. Tom once had three brothers, but
these were somehow unlucky and one by one they
dropped out of the game of life. The oldest
brother died with the smell of burnt black powder
in his nostrils, and Tom&#8217;s father stood over the
body and called his dead son a fool for wearing
his gun so it could stick in the holster. &#8220;If I ever
ketch yuh doin&#8217; a trick like that, I&#8217;ll thrash yuh
till yuh can&#8217;t stand,&#8221; he admonished young Tom
sternly. Young Tom always remembered how his
dad had looked when brother Bill was shot.</p>
<p>The second brother was overtaken while riding
a big sorrel horse that did not happen to carry the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
Lorrigan brand. So he too died with the smell of
powder smoke in his nostrils, taking three of his
pursuers with him into the Dark Land. Him
Tom&#8217;s father cursed for being caught.</p>
<p>So young Tom learned early two lessons of the
Black Rim book of wisdom: His gun must never
stick in the holster; he must never get caught by
the law.</p>
<p>He was twenty when Brother Jim was drowned
while trying to swim his horse across the Snake
in flood time on a dare. Young Tom raced along
the bank, frantically trying to cast his forty-foot
rope across sixty feet of rushing current that
rolled Jim and his horse along to the boil of rapids
below. Young Tom was a long, long while forgetting
the terror in Jim&#8217;s eyes, the helplessness
of Jim&#8217;s gloved hand which he threw up to catch
at the rope that never came within twenty feet of
him, and at the last, the hopeless good-by wave he
sent Tom when he whirled into the moil that pulled
him under and never let him go. Tom learned on
the bank of the Snake another lesson: He must
never be so weak as to let another man badger him
into doing something against his own desires or
judgment.</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s pitiful going left Tom in full possession
of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch and the cattle and
horses that fed on the open range of the Black
Rim country,&ndash;&ndash;and they were many. Young Tom
was lonely, but his loneliness was smothered under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
a consuming desire to add to his possessions and
to avoid the mistakes of his brothers and of his
father who had carelessly ridden where he should
have walked.</p>
<p>Men of the Rim country frequently predicted
that young Tom Lorrigan would die with his boots
on; preferably in mid-air. They said he was going
to be like his dad in more than looks, and that
times were changing and a man couldn&#8217;t steal
cattle and kill off anybody that argued with him,
and get away with it as Tom&#8217;s father had done.
They complained that the country was getting too
damn Sunday school, and young Tom had better
tame down a little before he got into trouble.</p>
<p>As Black Rim defines the word, Tom was quite
as bad as they called him. A handsome young
dare-devil he was, slanting his glance downward
when he looked into the eyes of a six-foot man,&ndash;&ndash;and
every inch of him good healthy bone and
muscle. Women eyed him pleasantly, wistful for
his smile. Men spoke to him friendlywise and
consciously side-stepped his wrath. On the Black
Rim range his word was law, his law was made
for himself and the wealth he hankered for. That
wealth he named a million dollars, and he named
it often because he liked the sound of the word.
Without any ifs he declared it. There was a million
to be had in Idaho, was there not? Very well,
he would have his million, and he would have it
in cattle and horses and land. He would not go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
mucking in the gold mines for it; his million should
graze on the bunch grass. He wanted, he said, to
see a million dollars walking around. And since
old Tom Lorrigan had left him a mere forty thousand&ndash;&ndash;according
to the appraisers of the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth estate&ndash;&ndash;young Tom had a long way to go
to see his dream a reality.</p>
<p>Men of the Black Rim hinted that young Tom
rode with a long rope; meaning that his rope
would reach the cattle of his neighbor cowmen if
they came in his way. But they only hinted, for
unless they could prove beyond the doubt of any
twelve men in the county that his brand was
burned on any cattle save his own, they had no
wish to offend. For young Tom had learned well
his three lessons from the fate of his three brothers;
his gun never stuck in its holster; he was wily
and not to be caught; he could neither be harried
nor coaxed into setting aside his own judgment
while it seemed to him good.</p>
<p>You would think that young Tom would speedily
find himself a mate amongst the girls of the
Black Rim country,&ndash;&ndash;though they were as scarce
as princesses of the royal blood and choice was of
necessity restricted to a half-dozen or so. None
of the girls he knew pleased his fancy, untrained
though that fancy might be. Instinct told him
that they were too tame, too commonplace to hold
his interest for long. A breathless dance or two,
a kiss stolen in a shadowy corner, and blushes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
giggles and inane remonstrances that bored him
because he knew they would come. Tom had
reached the sere age of twenty-two when he began
to wonder if he must go beyond the Black Rim
world for his wife, or resign himself to the fate of
an old bachelor. None of the Black Rim girls, he
told himself grimly, should ever have a share in
that million.</p>
<p>Then that purple-lidded, putty-face jade we call
Fate whimsically sent him a mate; curious, I suppose,
to see what would happen when the two
whose trails had lain so far apart should meet.</p>
<p>A girl from some far city she was; a small star
that had twinkled behind the footlights and had
fled&ndash;&ndash;or had fallen&ndash;&ndash;to the Black Rim country.
Like many another, she had gone as far as her
money would take her. That it took her to the
end of the little branch railroad that stopped
abruptly with its nose against a mountain twenty
miles from the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch was a coincidence,&ndash;&ndash;or
the whim of Fate. There she was, as
strange to the outland as young Tom would have
been to the city whence she had come; thinking
perhaps to start life afresh in some little Western
town; with no money to carry her back to the outskirts
of civilization, and no town wherein she
might win fresh successes. The train that had
brought her panted upon a siding, deserted, its
boiler cooling, its engineer, fireman, conductor and
brakeman leaning over a bar in the shack that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
called itself a saloon. To-morrow it would rattle
back to the junction, if all went well and the rails
held fast to the ties, which was not certain.</p>
<p>The station&#8217;s name was Jumpoff. The train&#8217;s
conductor, who had the misfortune to be considered
a humorist, liked to say that Jumpoff was a
knot at the end of the road to keep the track from
unraveling. He had told the girl that, on the
long, jolty ride from the junction. The girl replied
that at any rate she liked the name.</p>
<p>What really held Jumpoff on the time-table in
those days before it became a real town were the
stockyards, where the Black Rim cattle came to
start their journey to market. The trail over the
mountains to the main line was rough, with a two-day
drive without water. Yet the Black Rim
country had many cattle, and a matter of a few
tunnels and a trestle or two let the railroad in by
a short cut which minimized the distance to the
main line. The branch line paid a fair interest
on the investment,&ndash;&ndash;but not with its passenger
service.</p>
<p>The girl found herself stranded in a settlement
whose business was represented by one saloon, one
section house, one stable, one twelve-by-twelve
depot and a store that was no more than an addition
to the saloon, with the bartender officiating
in both places as customers required his services.
Times when cattle were being shipped, the store
was closed and the saloon had no rival.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>It was while the girl was hesitating half-way
between the store-saloon and the section house,
wondering which she would choose, that young
Tom Lorrigan galloped up to the hitch rail,
stopped his horse in two stiff-legged jumps, swung
down and came toward her. Like a picture on a
wall calendar she looked to young Tom, who had
never seen her like in flesh and blood. He lifted
his big, range hat, and she smiled at him,&ndash;&ndash;though
it must have been a stage smile, she had so little
heart for smiling then.</p>
<p>Tom blinked as though he had looked at the
sun. Such a smile he had never seen in his life;
nor such hair, like real, gold-colored silk all in
curls around her face; nor such eyes, which were
blue as the sky at twilight when the stars first
begin to show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumpoff is not much of a town,&#8221; said the girl
and laughed to hide how close she was to tears.</p>
<p>Young Tom caught his breath. He had thought
that women had only two forms of laughter, the
giggle of youth or the cackle of age. He had
never dreamed that a woman could laugh like a
mountain stream gurgling down over the rocks.
Immediately he visioned young ferns dripping
diamonds into a shadowed pool, though he did
not attempt to formulate the vision in words. His
answer was obvious and had nothing to do with
gurgling brooks, or with ferns and shadowed
pools.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It sure ain&#8217;t, Miss. Might you be looking for
somebody in particular?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m just here. It would be a poor
place to look for anybody, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure would.&#8221; Young Tom found his courage
and smiled, and the girl looked at him again, as
though she liked that white-toothed smile of
Tom&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I started out to find the jumping-off
place, and this sounded like it on the railroad map.
I guess it&#8217;s It, all right; there&#8217;s nothing to do but
jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Tom pulled his black eyebrows together,
studying her. By her speech she was human;
therefore, in spite of her beauty that dazzled him,
she was not to be feared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you ain&#8217;t got any particular place
to go from here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl tilted her head and stared up the mountain&#8217;s
steep, pine-covered slope. She swung her
head a little and looked at Tom. She smiled
bravely still, but he thought her eyes looked sorry
for something.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any particular place to go from here?&#8221;
she asked him wistfully, keeping the smile on her
lips as the world had taught her to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you went back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said, firmly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll climb that mountain and jump off the top
before I&#8217;ll go back.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>Young Tom felt that she spoke in sober earnest
in spite of her smile; which was strange. He had
seen men smile in deadly earnest,&ndash;&ndash;his dad had
smiled when he reached for his gun to kill Buck
Sanderson. But women cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know anybody at all, around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a soul&ndash;&ndash;except you, and I don&#8217;t know
whether your name is Tom or Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Tom&ndash;&ndash;Tom Lorrigan. Say! If
you ain&#8217;t got any place to go&ndash;&ndash;why&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve got a
ranch and about twenty-five hundred head of cattle
and some horses. If you didn&#8217;t mind marrying
me, I could take you out there and give yuh a
home. I&#8217;d be plumb good to you, if you&#8217;re willing
to take a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl stood back and looked him over. Tall
as Tom was she came almost to his chin. He saw
her eyes darken like the sky at dusk, and it seemed
to him quite possible that stars could shine in
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be taking as great a chance as I would.
I haven&#8217;t any ranch or any cattle, or anything at
all but myself and two trunks full of clothes and
some things in my life I want to forget. And I
have sixty cents in my purse. I can&#8217;t cook anything
except to toast marshmallows&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a cook,&#8221; put in young Tom quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the clothes I&#8217;ve got would be a joke out
here. And the things I came out here to forget
I shall never tell you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t interested enough to ask, or to listen if
you told me,&#8221; said Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;And myself can sing to you and dance to you,
and I&#8217;m twenty years old by the family Bible&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m twenty-two&ndash;&ndash;makes it about right,&#8221; said
Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you should count fifty and ask me
again&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten, twenty, thirty, forty-fifty, will you marry
me?&#8221; obeyed Tom with much alacrity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might call me Belle. Belle Delavan.
Well, I came to Jumpoff because&ndash;&ndash;I meant to
jump. Yes, I&#8217;ll marry you&ndash;&ndash;and the Lord have
mercy on you, Tom Lorrigan, if I live to regret
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amen. Same to you,&#8221; grinned Tom. &#8220;It&#8217;s
an even break, anyway. They don&#8217;t claim I&#8217;m
sprouting wings. They say I&#8217;ve got split hoofs
in my boots instead of feet, and wear my ears
pointed at the top. But&ndash;&ndash;but no girl has got any
loop on me. I&#8217;ve been straight, as far as women
goes. That&#8217;s my record up to the present. If
you can stand for a little drinkin&#8217; and gamblin&#8217;
and shootin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle waved aside his self-depreciation. Young
Tom was a handsome devil, and his eyes were
keen and clear and looked right into her own,
which was sufficient evidence of good faith for
any woman with warm blood in her body.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Lorrigan, I&#8217;ve eaten just three soda
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
crackers, six marshmallows and one orange since
yesterday noon,&#8221; said she irrelevantly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
be emotional when I&#8217;m half starved. Is there any
place where I can get a piece of bread or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Lord! Think of me standing here and not
thinkin&#8217; whether you&#8217;d had dinner or not! Sure,
you can have something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her by the arm, too penitent to be
diffident over the unaccustomed gallantry, and
hustled her toward the section house. His mind
registered the fact that the bartender, the fireman,
the brakeman and the conductor would shortly
apologize abjectly for standing outside the saloon
gawping at a lady, or they would need the immediate
ministrations of a doctor. He hoped the
girl had not noticed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll throw some grub together quick, over
here,&#8221; he explained to the girl. &#8220;Everybody eats
at the section house. It ain&#8217;t much of a place, but
there ain&#8217;t any other place. And while you&#8217;re
having dinner I&#8217;ll have the operator wire down
to Lava for a marriage license to be sent up on
the next train. The saloon man is a justice of the
peace, and he&#8217;ll marry us right away, soon as you
eat. And&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a license? I know it&#8217;s always done
that way on the stage, but&ndash;&ndash;but this isn&#8217;t going
to be any stage marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but the license will be all made out and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
on the way, and he&#8217;ll take my word for it and go
ahead with the ceremony. If I tell him to, he
will. It will be all right; I&#8217;ll <i>make</i> it all right.
And then I can get a team from a ranch back here
a ways, and take you right out to Devil&#8217;s Tooth.
It&#8217;s the best way. This ain&#8217;t any place for a lady
to stay. You&#8217;ll be comfortable out at the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s clean, anyway.&#8221; He looked at her
honest-eyed, and smiled again. &#8220;Yuh needn&#8217;t be
afraid uh me. We&#8217;re rough enough and tough
enough, and we maybe shoot up each other now
and again, but we ain&#8217;t like city folks; we don&#8217;t
double-cross women. Not ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said nothing, and when they had walked
four steps farther he added with a sincere wish
to set her at ease: &#8220;I could take you to some ranch
and leave you till the license comes, if you think
it wouldn&#8217;t be all right to get married now. But
the womenfolks would talk your arm off, and you
wouldn&#8217;t like it. And they&#8217;d talk about you when
your back was turned. But if Scotty goes ahead
and married us, I don&#8217;t see why&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not worrying about that. It&#8217;s just
cutting a corner instead of walking around. I
was thinking,&#8221; said Belle Delavan, while she
dabbed at her lashes as though they were beaded
with paint instead of tears and she must be careful
not to smear them, &#8220;I was just thinking how&ndash;&ndash;how
<i>good</i> you are. My God, I never knew they
grew men like you, outside of plays and poetry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; echoed young Tom Lorrigan, feared
of his kind for his badness. His tone was hushed
with amazement, all aglow with pleasure. &#8220;<i>Good!</i>&ndash;&ndash;my
Lord!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<h3>THE LORRIGAN TREE GROWS THRIFTILY</h3>
</div>
<p>Young Tom Lorrigan had found his mate.
Had he known more about life in the big
world beyond the Rim, he must have been amazed
at his luck. Once a man dropped dead in a poker
game when he had staked his last blue chip and
drawn a royal flush. In the great game of hearts
Tom had drawn a royal flush, but he did not drop
dead. Instead, he went right on living, more determined
than ever to own a million dollars&#8217; worth
of cattle and horses before he died, considerably
before he died, because he wanted to enjoy that
million with Belle. And because of her he wanted
that million to be honest money.</p>
<p>Everything he did now, he did for Belle more
than for himself. As a matter of course she became
his real reason for living. She was like the
sun. He took her for granted, never questioning
the blessed warmth of her presence, never stopping
to wonder what life would be like if he lost
her. She was beautiful, with a beauty that never
palled and never paled. She laughed a great deal,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
and he never could keep laughter from his own
lips while he listened. When she sang she put the
meadow larks to shame, and afterwards when he
rode the range alone Tom would whistle strange,
new melodies that the Black Rim country never
had heard before,&ndash;&ndash;melodies which Belle had
taught him unconsciously with her singing. He
did not know that it would have astonished a city
dweller to hear the bad man of Black Rim Country
whistling Schubert&#8217;s &#8220;Serenade&#8221; while he rode
after cattle, or Wagner&#8217;s &#8220;Prize Song,&#8221; or &#8220;Creole
Sue,&#8221; perhaps, since Belle, with absolute impartiality,
sang everything that she had ever
heard sung. On billboards before eastern theatres
Belle Delavan had been called &#8220;The Girl
with a Thousand Songs.&#8221; Audiences had been invited
by the stage manager to name any selection
they might choose, assured that Belle would sing
it from memory. No wonder that her singing
never grew stale to Tom Lorrigan!</p>
<p>But mostly she busied herself with little domesticities
that somehow never included cooking, and
with driving helter-skelter over the range with two
horses hitched to a buckboard, following Tom
when he rode after cattle. Do you think she
should logically have learned to ride? She did
try it once on the gentlest horse that Tom owned,
which was not too gentle to run away with Belle.
She rode that horse just two hundred yards before
she jolted so far from the saddle that she could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
find it again until some time after, when they had
caught the horse and led him to the corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not any more for me, Tom Lorrigan!&#8221; she
gasped, flapping her two pretty hands in eloquent
disgust when Tom rode up to her. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
get on a horse&#8217;s back again to star for the Queen
of England! I&#8217;ll take that team of he-devils
you&#8217;ve been breaking to drive, and I&#8217;ll drive &#8217;em
or break every bone in their bodies. I&#8217;m willing
to get behind any horse you&#8217;ve got; but to get on
their backs&ndash;&ndash;excuse me!&#8221; She limped painfully
to the house with her yellow hair blowing around
her shoulders and across her lips that would smile
in spite of her mishap.</p>
<p>After that Belle drove the &#8220;he-devils&#8221; and others
quite as devilish, and risked her bones with
perfect equanimity. She drove horses that had
to be thrown before the collar could be buckled on,
and &#8220;forefooted&#8221; before they would submit to the
harness. Indeed, Belle seemed to prefer that kind
of horses. She wanted a team that could keep
pace with Tom,&ndash;&ndash;and she had it. Her buckboard
lasted a year, with luck. She strewed the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth range with wheels and doubletrees and
splinters and hairpins, and scattered sunshiny
smiles and cuss-words and snatches of song wherever
she went. And since she went wherever
eight bronco feet could take her, Black Rim country
came to know Belle Lorrigan as it knew Tom.
Came to fear Belle Lorrigan&#8217;s wrath, which bettered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
the lightning for searing, lashing sword-thrusts
of venom; came to know her songs well
enough to hum snatches of them; came to laugh
when she laughed,&ndash;&ndash;and to hope that the next
laugh would not be aimed at them; came to recognize
her as a better shot than any one save Tom,
who taught her.</p>
<p>At the country dances on the various ranches,
Belle never missed quadrille, two-step, waltz or
schottische, and she danced by herself or sang
songs during the intervals, while the women of the
range sat stiffly along the walls on benches, stared
at Belle and whispered behind their weather-reddened
hands, and tittered. She taught big-jointed,
bashful boys how to waltz, and she slapped a half-drunken
miner who squeezed her too tightly in a
square dance. Slapped Tom also when he came
hurrying up to kill the miner, and told him to keep
to his own quarrels and save his powder for something
worth while. She didn&#8217;t need help to step
on a worm, she added, and took a youth by the arm
and led him off to dance. The miner, I may say
to the curious, was next seen in Hailey, heading
south. He left a very good prospect up in the
hills and never went back to work out his assessments.</p>
<p>As you have probably guessed, Belle Lorrigan
and the women of the Black Rim country did not
get on very well together. Black Rim women
thought that a woman who wore her hair in curls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
down her back&ndash;&ndash;yellow hair at that!&ndash;&ndash;could not
be any too good if the truth were known. They
declared to one another that a woman who did not
talk about her past life, who never so much as
mentioned past illnesses, even, must have a great
deal to cover up. How did Tom Lorrigan get
acquainted with her, anyway? Through some
marriage agency, they were willing to bet. And
how did a decent woman happen to have all the
fancy clothes which Belle Lorrigan possessed?
And jewelry enough to stock a store with! Three
rings on one finger at one time and the same time
was going it pretty strong, in the opinion of the
Black Rim ladies. They also believed that she
used paint and powder, which damned her beyond
all hope of redemption.</p>
<p>Poor Belle Lorrigan (Black Rim country spoke
of her always as Belle Lorrigan without in the
least understanding why she remained an individual
personality to them instead of becoming
merely Mrs. Lorrigan&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Tom, even, since
many of the Black Rim women were designated by
the nicknames of their husbands)! She would
have been glad to be friendly, simply because
friendliness was in her blood and would out. She
would have been glad to receive them at the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth ranch for one of those all-day visits which
were the custom of the country. But for a long
while they did not come. Sometimes she would
meet a family bundled to the eyes against the chill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
winds of Idaho, bumping over the rough roads on
their way to visit some near neighbor who lived
only ten or fifteen miles away. She would flash
them a smile while she pulled up her bronco team
out of the trail to make a generous room for their
passing, and she would shout something pleasant
as they went by. And after they had gone on she
would shrug her fine, broad shoulders and call
them cats, going out to a scratching, with all the
kittens mewing along. She would flap a hand&ndash;&ndash;providing
the bronco team left her a hand free to
flap&ndash;&ndash;and shake her head, and say, &#8220;Not for
mine, thank you!&#8221; And would be hurt down deep
in her heart where it did not show, because they
never stopped at her door.</p>
<p>But when the boys began to come, then came the
neighbor women, making formal two-hour calls
upon the new mother, eager to see and to hear and
to go away and compare notes afterward. They
talked much of the names that Belle Lorrigan
called her children. The first one she named for
the hero in her first play; wanting, I suppose, a
souvenir of the time when she was fifteen and had
her first speaking part on the stage. She called
her first-born Algernon Adelbert. Algernon Adelbert
Lorrigan, grandson of old Tom Lorrigan!
Think of that!</p>
<p>But Algernon Adelbert no sooner outgrew his
cradle than he was known to all and sundry as
Al Lorrigan, so that no harm was done him in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
giving him such a name. He grew up lusty and
arrogant, a good deal of a bully, six feet tall, a
good rider&ndash;&ndash;though, not so good a rider as his
dad&ndash;&ndash;a good shot, willing to help gather that
million together on the chance that he might have
a share in the spending.</p>
<p>Al was a youth who hunted trouble for the thrill
of meeting it more than half-way, but since Tom
Lorrigan happened to be his father, Al rode off
the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch before he became the
rampant young trouble-hunter. Belle had some
anxious hours during the time Al was gone, but
she never once betrayed her anxiety; which is
doing pretty well for a mother.</p>
<p>The second was Marmaduke LeRoy, and the
third and last she recklessly christened Lancelot
Montgomery. Marmaduke never learned to spell
his name correctly, and sometimes complained that
Belle had gone and named him after a mess of
preserves,&ndash;&ndash;meaning marmalade, I suppose. But
as he grew older he forgot his grievance. Belle
was the only person who could remember offhand
his full name, and she never called him by it except
when she was very angry; when she usually attached
so many adjectives that Marmaduke LeRoy
was quite submerged. Commonly he was called
Duke, which did well enough.</p>
<p>Tom used to study Duke through half-closed
lids and the smoke of a cigarette, and wonder
which side of the family had a yellow streak; not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the Lorrigan side, so far as Tom could judge.
Nor the Delavan side either, if Belle lived true to
type. To be sure, Belle refused to ride a horse;
but then Belle was a woman and women had
whims. There was no yellow about Belle, except
her hair which was pure golden.</p>
<p>Duke would invariably lie to dodge punishment.
According to his own theory, Duke was always
blameless, always the injured party, the boy who
does right and never is given credit for his virtues.
Even Belle, who would fight for her boys as a
tigress fights for its young, looked askance at
Duke while she tried, motherlike, to cover his
faults from the keen eyes of Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just like to know how you come by it,&#8221; she
once exclaimed exasperatedly, when Duke was ten
and Lance eight. &#8220;I&#8217;d sure chop one limb off the
family tree, if I knew which one gave you the gall
to lie to me and Tom. Duke, for heaven&#8217;s sake
take a licking just once without trying to lay the
blame on Al or Lance&ndash;&ndash;and see how proud you&#8217;ll
feel afterwards!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw&ndash;&ndash;lickins hur-rt!&#8221; Duke had protested,
rubbing the arm Belle had gripped none too gently,
and sidled away from her.</p>
<p>With her hands to her hips&ndash;&ndash;gracefully posed
there, as became an actress&ndash;&ndash;Belle regarded him
fixedly. &#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; she whispered, owning defeat
before that invulnerable selfishness of Duke&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Her tone stung even his young crocodile-hided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
sensibility. &#8220;You&#8217;re always blamin&#8217; me. You&#8217;n
Tom think I do everything mean on this ranch!
You think Lance is an angel! He&#8217;s your pet and
you let him pick on me an&#8217; you never say a word.
Lance can do any darn thing he pleases, an&#8217; so
can Al. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to run away, first thing you
know. You can have your sweet little angel pet
of a doggone ole cowardly-calf Lance!&#8221; Then he
whined, &#8220;Aw&ndash;&ndash;you lemme go! I never done it,
I tell yuh! It was Lance!&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle gritted her teeth while she shook him.
&#8220;You yellow-hearted little whelp. I <i>saw you</i>
chasing that colt around the corral till he broke
the fence! If Tom was to know about it he&#8217;d lick
you good! Duke, why <i>can&#8217;t</i> you be a man and take
the blame yourself, just once? I&#8217;d be&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d be so
proud o&#8217; you if you only told the truth about
things. Don&#8217;t you know&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s only a coward that
will lie to save his own skin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance is a bigger coward than I am, an&#8217; you
never say a word to him. You think Lance is perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re hopeless all right,&#8221; Belle retorted.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a yellow streak in you somewhere.
Living with the Lorrigans, I&#8217;m hoping
you&#8217;ll outgrow it. The Lorrigans sure ain&#8217;t
yellow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I chased Blackie some, Belle,&#8221; Lance volunteered,
peering down over the stable eave at his
irate mother. &#8220;Duke started in and got him going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
good, and when he come fogging over to this side I
flopped my arms at him. Gee, but he did stop
quick! I guess if you&#8217;re going to lick Duke, you
better give me about four good licks for that,
Belle. And take &#8217;em off Duke&#8217;s licking. No use
licking us both for the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle tilted her yellow head and looked up at
her beloved youngest, grinning down at her cheerfully
from the hay roof where he sprawled head
downward, flat on his stomach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, thank the Lord one Lorrigan has got the
nerve to own up to a thing. Come on down and
get your four licks, then. I can be as square as
the next one. But Duke&#8217;s got it coming to him
for lying to me. Tell me, Lance, did Duke chase
Blackie through the fence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw go on, Belle! What&#8217;s matter with you,
asking me what Duke done? He&#8217;s the feller to ask
about that. I chased Blackie about four licks&#8217;
worth. Hurry up and let&#8217;s get it over with. You
know it ain&#8217;t pleasant for either of us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smarty!&#8221; yelled Duke, quick to read in Belle&#8217;s
face what softening effect Lance had on her temper.
&#8220;Tryin&#8217; to be smart&ndash;&ndash;tryin&#8217; to be George
Wash&#8217;nton! You little liar, you know you chased
Blackie more&#8217;n what I done. Sneak out of it&ndash;&ndash;yeah,
that&#8217;s you, every time. Own up just enough
to make Belle think you&#8217;re an angel. Doggone
the whole doggone outfit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Now</i> what?&#8221; Tom&#8217;s voice broke in upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Duke&#8217;s shrill tirade. From the back of his horse
Tom looked down quizzically upon them. &#8220;Duke,
what you been up to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you always think it&#8217;s me! Why don&#8217;t you
ask Lance what he&#8217;s been up to? Why don&#8217;t you
lick Lance for being on the stable? If I was to get
up there and tromp around in the hay and make it
leak, I know what <i>I&#8217;d</i> git!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom sent a glance up to where Lance was hastily
scrambling down a corner. &#8220;You&#8217;d better!&#8221; he
commented sternly. Then he looked at Belle, his
eyes twinkling under his scowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t handle these young devils, Belle,
turn &#8217;em over to me. I&#8217;ll mighty quick settle their
hash for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle gripped tighter the squirming Duke. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not a cripple yet, Tom Lorrigan. They&#8217;ve both
got a licking coming to &#8217;em, and if you&#8217;ll kindly
walk off stage R. C. I&#8217;ll go on with the scene. You
weren&#8217;t cued to come on here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your show, Belle,&#8221; Tom assented, and
very obligingly rode to the other side of the stable
to unsaddle his horse, and grinned to himself when
the sound of wailing and pleading and promises of
the &#8220;I&#8217;ll-never-do-it-again&#8221; variety came to his
ears. Belle&#8217;s lickings were distinguished chiefly
by their uproar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Belle wallops &#8217;em like brandin&#8217; calves,&#8221; Tom
used to chuckle. &#8220;They beller a plenty while it&#8217;s
going on, and kick up their heels when it&#8217;s all over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
I wish&#8217;t my dad had licked me like that when I
was a kid. You can gamble, when I was thrashed,
I knowed it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Duke grew up to be a very good cowpuncher,
however. He knew every draw and dry wash,
every creek bottom and every canyon on the Black
Rim range; knew almost as well as the owner how
many cattle carried every brand. In the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth round-ups Duke held his place alongside Al
as a top hand,&ndash;&ndash;disputing now and then the right
of young Lance to compete with him, but never
quite daring to bring his dispute to the point where
action would take the place of words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duke&#8217;s sure enough a bad man&ndash;&ndash;with his
face,&#8221; Tom once snarled to Belle. &#8220;Make it a
talking match, and Duke could lick any old woman,
in the Black Rim country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been enough fighting Lorrigans, don&#8217;t
you think?&#8221; Belle smiled back at him. &#8220;Duke&#8217;s
dad can fight hard enough for the whole family.
I didn&#8217;t think you wanted your boys to be fighters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. But I sure do want &#8217;em to have the
fightin&#8217; stuff in &#8217;em, whether it ever comes out
or not. Take Lance, there. Lance ain&#8217;t a fighter,
either; but by the Lord John, it&#8217;s there! Once get
Lance started, and I&#8217;d back him against any three
men in the Black Rim. It&#8217;s in him, if the play
ever come up. And it&#8217;s in Al. The Lorrigan is
strong in Al. But that Duke&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Honey, I think maybe it&#8217;s the Delavan in Duke.
I remember an old maid aunt of mine that used
to bolt the door and quarrel with my mother
through the keyhole. I guess maybe Duke has got
a little touch of Aunt Jane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure! First I ever heard of Aunt Jane,
Belle. Takes you to think up a reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Lorrigan will come out, honey. He&#8217;s
got the look, now and then. It&#8217;s in him, you&#8217;ll
see.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that is how the Lorrigan boys grew up. They
thought Belle the most beautiful, the most wonderful
woman in the world,&ndash;&ndash;though they never
called her mother. Belle would not have it. She
refused to become a motherly, middle-aged person,
and her boys were growing altogether too big and
too masterful to look upon a golden-curled, pink-cheeked,
honey-throated Amazon as other Black
Rim sons looked upon their faded, too often shrewish
maternal parent. She was just Belle. They
knew no other like her, no one with whom they
might compare her. We do not compare the sun
and the moon with other suns and moons. Like
Tom, they worshipped her in their hearts, and
chummed with her even before they had outgrown
her stormy chastisements. They mended her
buckboards and her harness; they galloped alongside
while she drove careening across the range,
her hair flying in the wind, her mouth smiling and
showing her white teeth. They danced with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
her,&ndash;&ndash;and having Belle for a teacher from the time
they could toddle, you may guess how the Lorrigan
boys could dance. They sang the songs she
taught them; they tried to better her record at
target practice and never did it; they quarreled
with her when her temper was up and dodged her
when it became too cyclonic.</p>
<p>They grew up without ever having ridden on
the cars, save once or twice to Lava. Black Rim
was the rim of the world to them, and their world
held all that they yearned for. Belle sheltered
them from too much knowledge of that other
world, which held the past she hated and tried to
forget. Much she taught them of city manners
and the little courtesies of life. She would box
the ears of the boy who neglected to rise and offer
her a chair when she entered a room, and would
smoke a cigarette with him afterward. Once she
whipped her six-shooter out of its holster and shot
a hole through the crown of Al&#8217;s hat, as a tactful
reminder that gentlemen always remove their hats
when they come into a house. Al remembered,
after that. At fourteen even the hardiest youth
feels a slight shock when a bullet jars through his
hat crown two inches above his hair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<h3>MARY HOPE DOUGLAS APPEARS</h3>
</div>
<p>Devil&#8217;s Tooth ridge, which gave the Lorrigan
ranch its name, was really a narrow
hogback with a huge rock spire at one end.
Crudely it resembled a lower jaw bone with one
lone tooth remaining. Three hundred feet and
more the ridge upthrust its barren crest, and the
wagon road from the ranch crawled up over it in
many switchbacks and sharp turns, using a mile
and a half in the climbing. They called it the
&#8220;dug road.&#8221; Which meant that teams and
scrapers and dynamite and much toil had been
necessary in the making, distinguishing it from
most Black Rim roads, which followed the line of
least resistance until many passings had worn a
definite trail; whereupon that trail became an
established thoroughfare legalized by custom and
not to be lightly changed for another.</p>
<p>Over in the next valley, beyond Devil&#8217;s Tooth
ridge, Alexander Douglas had made a ranch for
himself and his family. Aleck Douglas was as
Scotch as his name. He shaved his long upper
lip, so that it looked longer and more uncompromising
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
than was necessary even to match the
Aleck Douglas disposition. His hair was wiry
and stood up from a forehead that might be called
beetling. His eyebrows were heavy and came so
near to meeting that Mary Hope used to wish that
she dared lay one small finger between father&#8217;s
eyebrows, just to see if there would be room. His
eyes were as close together as his thin beak of a
nose would permit, and his ears were long and
narrow and set flat against his head. He was tall
and he was lank and he was honest to his last
bristling hair. He did not swear&ndash;&ndash;though he
could wither one with vituperative epithets&ndash;&ndash;and
he did not smoke and he did not drink&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;save
a wee nip of Scotch &#8220;whusky&#8221; to break up a cold,
which frequently threatened his hardy frame. He
was harshly religious, and had there been a church
in the Black Rim country you would have seen
Aleck Douglas drive early to its door every Sunday
morn, and sit straight-backed in a front pew
and stare hard at the minister through the longest
of sermons,&ndash;&ndash;providing, of course, that church
and minister were good Presbyterian.</p>
<p>He loved the dollars, how he did love his dollars!
He loved his cattle, because they represented dollars.
He nursed them, dollars and animals alike,
and to lose one wrung the heart of him.</p>
<p>His wife was a meek little thing in his presence,
as the wives of such men as Aleck Douglas usually
are. She also was rigidly honest, dogmatically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
religious and frugal and hard-working and intolerant
of the sins of others.</p>
<p>Early she taught Mary Hope that beyond
Devil&#8217;s Tooth ridge lived those wicked Lorrigans,
whose souls were bartered to the devil and whose
evil ways were a stench in the nostrils of God.
Mary Hope used to wonder if God turned up his
nose when there was a stench in his nostrils,&ndash;&ndash;for
instance, when Belle Lorrigan hurtled past
with her bronks and her buckboard and her yellow
hair flying. Mary Hope wondered, too, what the
Lorrigan boys had got from the devil in exchange
for their souls. Some magic, perhaps, that would
protect them from death and accident. Yet that
seemed not true, for Al Lorrigan broke his leg,
one spring round-up. The devil ought to have
saved his horse from falling down with him, if the
devil had Al Lorrigan&#8217;s soul.</p>
<p>That had happened when Mary Hope was twelve
and Al Lorrigan was eighteen. She heard her
father tell her mother about it; and her father had
set his whiskered lip against his long, shaven
upper lip almost with a smack.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll come to a bad end, all of them,&#8221; he
declared sententiously. &#8220;Violent deaths had all
the Lorrigans before them&ndash;&ndash;all save Tom, and
the Lord but stays his hand for a time from that
man. The wicked shall flourish as a green bay
tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, how can a tree be green and then bay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
too!&#8221; Mary Hope ventured to inquire. &#8220;Is it
just a Bible tree, or does it flourish somewhere
really?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aleck Douglas hid his month behind his palm
and coughed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis not bay like a horse, child.
&#8217;Tis not the color that I&#8217;m speaking of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That painted Jezebel, Belle Lorrigan, drove
past the house to-day within a stone&#8217;s throw,&#8221;
Mrs. Douglas informed her husband. &#8220;I wush,
Aleck, that ye would fence me a yard to keep the
huzzy from driving over my very doorstep. She
had that youngest brat of hers in the seat with
her&ndash;&ndash;that Lance. And as they went past on the
keen gallop&ndash;&ndash;and the horses both in a lather of
sweat&ndash;&ndash;the boy impudently shook his fist at me
where I was glancing from my window. And his
mother lookit and laughed, the Jezebel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, Lance only waved his hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why should Lance be waving his hand
when he should pass the house? Did he think that
a Douglas would come so low as to wave at a
Lorrigan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope ducked her sleek little pig-tailed
head outside the door and shooed vehemently at a
dingy black hen that happened to be passing.
Mary Hope knew that a Douglas had stooped so
low as to wave back at Lance Lorrigan, but it
seemed unwise to tell her mother so.</p>
<p>When Mary Hope was permitted to have a
gentle old cow-pony of her own, she rode as often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
as she dared to Devil&#8217;s Tooth ridge. By short
cuts down certain washes which the trail avoided
with many winding detours, she could lope to the
foot of the ridge in forty minutes by the old alarm
clock which she carried one day in her arms to
time the trip. She could climb by another shortcut
trail, to the Devil&#8217;s Tooth in twenty minutes.
She could come down in fifteen, she discovered.
In a three-hour ride she could reach the-Devil&#8217;s
Tooth, spend a whole hour looking down upon the
ranch house of the wicked Lorrigans, and ride
home again. And by choosing the short cuts she
practically eliminated the chance of being observed.</p>
<p>If she could see Belle go tearing down the trail
with her bronks and her buckboard she would be
horrifiedly happy. The painted Jezebel fascinated
Mary Hope, who had read all about that wicked
woman in the Bible, and had shivered in secret at
her terrible fate. Belle Lorrigan might never be
eaten by dogs, since dogs are few in cattleland
and are kept strictly at home, but if Mary Hope&#8217;s
mother was any true prophetess, the painted Jezebel&#8217;s
final doom would be quite as horrible.</p>
<p>At the infrequent parties which the Douglas
household countenanced,&ndash;&ndash;such as Christmas
trees and Fourth of July picnics, Mary Hope
would sit and stare fixedly at Belle Lorrigan and
wonder if all painted Jezebels were beautiful and
happy and smiling. If so, why was unadorned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
virtue to be commended? Mary tried not to wish
that her hair was yellow and hung in curls, and
that she had even white teeth and could sing and
dance so wonderfully that everything stopped and
every one looked and listened from the minute
she began until she stopped.</p>
<p>More than anything else in her starved young
life, Mary Hope wanted to see the inside of the
Lorrigan house. The painted Jezebel had a real
piano, and she could play it, people said. She
played ungodly songs, but Mary Hope had a venturesome
spirit. She wanted to see an instrument
of the devil, hear the painted Jezebel play on it
and sing her ungodly songs.</p>
<p>One day when she had ridden to the top of the
Devil&#8217;s Tooth a great, daring plan came to her.
She wanted to ride down there&ndash;&ndash;a half mile down
the bluff, a mile and a half by the road&ndash;&ndash;but she
would never dare take that trail deliberately. Her
father might hear of it, or her mother. Nor could
she ask the Lorrigans not to tell of her visit. But
if her horse ran away with her and took her down
the ridge, she could ask them to please not tell her
father, because if he knew that her horse ran away
he would not let her ride again. It seemed to
Mary Hope that all the Lorrigans would sympathize
with her dilemma. They would probably ask
her into the house. She would see the piano, and
she could ask the painted Jezebel to play on it.
That would be only polite. It did seem a shame
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
that a girl thirteen years old, going on fourteen,
should never have seen or heard a piano. Mary
Hope looked at the sun and made breathless calculation.
Having just arrived at the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth, she had an hour to spend. And if she took
the steep, winding trail that the Lorrigans rode,
the trail where old man Lorrigan&#8217;s horse had
fallen down with him, she could be at the house in
a very few minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye look little enough like a runaway horse, ye
wind-broken, spavined old crow-bait, you!&#8221; she
criticized Rab as he stood half asleep in the sun.
&#8220;I shall have to tell a lee about you, and for that
God may wither the tongue of me. I shall say that
a rattler buzzed beneath your nose&ndash;&ndash;though perhaps
I should say it was behind ye, Rab, else they
will wonder that ye didna run away home. If ye
could but lift an ear and roll the eye of you, wild-like,
perhaps they will believe me. But I dinna
ken&ndash;&ndash;I wouldna believe it mesel!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rab waggled an ear when she mounted, switched
his tail pettishly when she struck him with the
quirt, reluctantly obeyed the rein, and set his feet
on the first steep pitch of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth trail.
Old as he was, Rab had never gone down that trail
and he chose his footing circumspectly. It was
no place for a runaway, as Mary Hope speedily
discovered when she had descended the first dip
and entered the cleft which the Lorrigans called
the Slide.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>A slide it was, and down it Rab slid on his rump.
An old watercourse, with sheer rock walls that
formed the base of the Tooth itself. Had there
been room Mary Hope would have turned back.
But the cleft was so narrow that a pack horse
must be adept at squeezing past protuberances and
gauging the width of its pack if it would travel the
trail. A sharp turn presently showed her the end
of the cleft, and they emerged thankfully upon a
sage-grown shelf along which the trail proceeded
more gently.</p>
<p>Then came another cleft, with great boulders at
the end, which a horse must negotiate carefully if
he would not break a leg or two. It was here that
old Tom Lorrigan had died under his horse before
help came that way. But Rab had covered many
rough trails, and he picked his way over the
boulders safely,&ndash;&ndash;though not as a runaway horse
should have traveled.</p>
<p>After that there came a treacherous bit of shale,
across which Mary Hope thought it best to lead
her runaway steed which refused for a time to
venture farther. Being a Douglas she was obstinate.
Being obstinate, she would not turn back,
especially since the trail would be even worse in
the climbing than it was in the descent. Rab, she
realized worriedly, could not slide up that narrow,
rock-bottomed cleft down which he had coasted so
readily.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must be devil horses that ride this way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
Rab,&#8221; she sighed when she had remounted on
the lower margin of the shale. &#8220;And the Lorrigans
na doot have magic. But I dinna think that
even they could run away down it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She struck Rab sharply with the quirt and dug
in her heels. If Rab was to run it must be immediately,
for the level valley lay just below and the
Lorrigan house was around the next point of the
hill.</p>
<p>Rab would not run. He stopped abruptly and
kicked with both feet. Mary Hope struck him
again, a little harder, and Rab kicked again, more
viciously. The trail was much better for kicking
than for running, but Mary Hope would not accept
the compromise, and at last Rab yielded to the
extent of loping cautiously down the last steep
declivity. When he reached level ground he laid
back his ears and galloped as fast as his stiffened
shoulders would let him. So Mary Hope very
nearly achieved a dashing pace as she neared the
corrals of the wicked Lorrigans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Yuh traveling, or just goin&#8217; somewhere?&#8221;
A young voice yelled at her as she went
past the stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;My horse&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;he rinned away wi&#8217; me!&#8221;
screamed Mary Hope, her pigtails snapping as
Rab slowed up and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;He rinned away wi&#8217; you? When? You musta
been purty young for riding when <i>that</i> horse
rinned away!&#8221; Lance came toward her, grinning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
and slapping his hat against his fringed chaps
before he set it upon his head; an uncommonly
handsome head, by the way, with the Lorrigan&#8217;s
dark eyes and hair and his mother&#8217;s provocative
mouth. &#8220;Well, seeing your horse ain&#8217;t going to
rin no further, you might as well git down and
stay awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not. I didna come to visit, if you
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope&#8217;s cheeks were hot but confusion
could not break her Scotch spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to borrow something?&#8221; Lance stood
looking at her with much enjoyment. A girl in
short skirts was fair game for any one&#8217;s teasing,
especially when she blushed as easily as did Mary
Hope. &#8220;Want to borrow a horse that will rin
away wi&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance, you devil, get out and leave the girl
alone. I&#8217;m ashamed of you! Haven&#8217;t you got
any manners at all?&ndash;&ndash;after all the willows and
the good powder I&#8217;ve wasted on you! Get back to
that pasture fence before I take a club to you for
such acting!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Belle&#8217;s wrath Lance retreated, and Mary
Hope found the courage to wrinkle her nose at
him when he glanced her way. &#8220;He rinned away
to save himself a whupping,&#8221; she commented, and
made sure that he heard it, and hoped that he
would realize that she spoke &#8220;Scotchy&#8221; just for
his special benefit.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>&#8220;All right for you, Belle Lorrigan!&#8221; Lance
called back, retaliating for Mary Hope&#8217;s grimace
by a kiss thrown brazenly in the expectation of
seeing her face grow redder; which it did immediately.
&#8220;Careful of that horse&ndash;&ndash;he might
rinned away again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do for you, young man!&#8221; Whereupon
Belle picked up a small stone and threw it with
such accurate aim that Lance&#8217;s hat went off.
&#8220;Good thing for you that I haven&#8217;t got a gun on
me, or I&#8217;d dust your heels for you!&#8221; Then she
turned to Mary Hope, who was listening with titillating
horror to the painted Jezebel&#8217;s unorthodox
method of reproving her offspring. &#8220;Get right
down, honey, and come in and rest. And don&#8217;t
mind Lance; he&#8217;s an awful tease, especially when
he likes a person. Tie your horse to the fence&ndash;&ndash;or
turn him in the corral, if he&#8217;ll let you catch
him again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t believe I could stop. I&ndash;&ndash;I only
came by because I&ndash;&ndash;my horse&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Mary Hope
stammered and blushed so red that her freckles
were invisible. After all, it was very hard to tell
a lie, she discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I like about this horse,&#8221;
said Belle, running her plump white hand down
the nose of Rab. &#8220;He&#8217;s neighborly, anyway. He
brought you here against your will, I can see that.
And now he&#8217;s here he sort of takes it for granted
you&#8217;ll be friendly and stop a while. Don&#8217;t you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
think you ought to be as friendly as your horse,
honey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I am friendly. I&ndash;&ndash;I always wished I
could come and see you. But mother&ndash;&ndash;mother
doesna visit much among the neighbors; she&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s
always busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t visit much, myself,&#8221; said Belle dryly.
&#8220;But that ain&#8217;t saying I can&#8217;t be friendly. Come
on in, and we&#8217;ll have some lemonade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheer astonishment brought Mary Hope down
from her horse. All her life she had taken it for
granted that lemonade was sacred to the Fourth
of July picnics, just as oranges grew for Christmas
trees only. She followed Belle dumbly into
the house, and once inside she remained dumb with
awe at what seemed to her to be the highest pinnacle
of grandeur.</p>
<p>There was the piano with a fringed scarf draped
upon its top, and pictures in frames standing upon
the scarf in orderly rows. There were many
sheets of music,&ndash;&ndash;and never a hymn book. There
were great chairs with deep upholstery which
Mary observed with amazement was not red plush,
nor even blue plush, yet which appealed to her
instincts for beauty. There was no center table
with fringed spread and family album and a Bible
and a conch shell. Instead there was a long table
before a window&ndash;&ndash;a table littered with all sorts
of things: a box of revolver cartridges, a rifle laid
down in the middle of scattered newspapers, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
bottle of oil, more music, a banjo, a fruit jar that
did duty as a vase for wild flowers, a half-finished,
braided quirt and four silver dollars lying where
they had been carelessly flung down. To Mary
Hope, reared in a household where dollars were
precious things, that last item was the most amazing
of all. The Lorrigans must be rich,&ndash;&ndash;as rich
as they were wicked. She thrilled anew at her
own daring.</p>
<p>Belle brought lemonade, wonderful lemonade,
with an egg beaten to yellow froth and added the
last minute. Mary Hope sipped and marveled.
After that, Belle played on the piano and sang
songs which Mary Hope had never heard before
and which she thought must be the songs the
angels sang in Heaven, although there was nothing
to suggest harps or hallelujahs. Love songs they
were, mostly. The sun slipped around and shone
through a window on Belle&#8217;s head, so that her yellow
hair glistened like fine threads of gold. Mary
Hope watched it dreamily and wondered how a
Jezebel could be so beautiful and so good.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better run along home now, honey,&#8221;
Belle said at last when she had finished her eighth
song. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to have you stay all night&ndash;&ndash;but
I reckon there&#8217;d be trouble. Your dad ain&#8217;t any
too mild, I&#8217;ve heard. But I hope you won&#8217;t wait
until your horse runs away with you again. I
want you to come real soon. And come early so
you can stay longer. I&#8217;ll teach you to play the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
piano, honey. You ought to learn, seeing you love
it so.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night Mary Hope dreamed of playing
strange, complex compositions on a piano which
Lance Lorrigan had given her. The next morning
and for many days after she still dreamed of playing
entrancing strains upon a piano, and of Lance
Lorrigan who had thrown her a kiss. Belle had
said that Lance always teased a person he liked,
and in that one remark lay the stuff of many
dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<h3>A MATTER OF BRANDS</h3>
</div>
<p>On the grassy expanse known locally as Injun
Creek, fifteen hundred head of cattle were
milling restlessly in a close-held herd over which
gray dust hovered and settled and rose again.
Toward it other cattle came lowing, trotting now
and then when the riders pressed close, essaying a
retreat when the way seemed clear. From Devil&#8217;s
Tooth they came, and from Lava Bed way, and
from the rough sandstone ridges of Mill Creek.
Two by two the riders, mere moving dots at first
against a monotone of the rangeland, took form as
they neared the common center. Red cattle, black
cattle, spotted and dingy white, with bandy-legged,
flat-bodied calves keeping close to their mothers,
kicking up their heels in sheer joy of their new life
when the pace slowed a little, seeking a light lunch
whenever the cows stopped to cast a wary glance
back at their pursuer. A dozen brands were represented
in that foregathering: The NL brand of
Tom Lorrigan on most, with its various amendments
which differentiated the property of other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
members of the family, since all of the Lorrigans
owned cattle. There was the NL Block of Belle
Lorrigan, the ANL which was Al&#8217;s brand, the
DNL of Duke and the LNL which belonged to
Lance; monograms all of them, deftly constructed
with the fewest possible lines. There was that
invitation to the unlawful artistry of brand-working,
the Eleven which Sleek Douglas thought quite
sufficient to mark his cattle. It was merciful to
the calves, he maintained, and as to thieves, the
dishonest would be punished by law and the Douglas
wrath. The Miller brand, a plain Block,
showed now and then upon the rump of some animal.
The AJ fled occasionally before a rider, and
there were brands alien to the Black Rim; brands
on cattle that had drifted down from the Snake
through the Lava Creek pass, or over the sage-grown
ridges farther north.</p>
<p>His rifle sheathed in a saddle holster under his
thigh, his black eyes roving here and there and
letting no small movement of men or animals
escape their seeing glances, Tom Lorrigan rode
to the round-up, lord of the range, steadfast upon
the trail of his &#8220;million on the hoof&#8221; of which he
dreamed. Beside him rode Al, and the two of
them were talking while they rode.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t safe, I tell you,&#8221; Al was saying in
the tone of reiteration. &#8220;And you needn&#8217;t ask
me how I know. I know it, that&#8217;s all. Maybe
he&#8217;s too damn&#8217; agreeable or something. Anyway,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
I know I don&#8217;t like the way his eyes set in his
head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man that wasn&#8217;t safe wouldn&#8217;t dare come
into the Black Rim and make the play he&#8217;s makin&#8217;,&#8221;
Tom contended. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had my eye on him
ever since he come. I&#8217;ve checked up what he says
at different times&ndash;&ndash;they tally like the truth. I
can&#8217;t find nothing wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got him set down for a spotter,&#8221; said Al.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he ain&#8217;t on the level it&#8217;ll show up sooner or
later,&#8221; Tom contended. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my eye on him.
I dunno what you pin your argument on, Al, I&#8217;ll
be darned if I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, watch out for Cheyenne. That&#8217;s all.
You&#8217;re pretty keen, all right, but all a man&#8217;s got
to do to get on your blind side is to blow in here
with his chin on his shoulder and his horse rode
to a whisper and claim to you he&#8217;s hidin&#8217; out.
Cheyenne ain&#8217;t right, I tell yuh. You take a tip
from me and watch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Takes a kid to tell his dad where to head in
at!&#8221; growled Tom. &#8220;How do you reckon I ever
got along before your time. Ever figure that out,
Al?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what&#8217;s eatin&#8217; on old Scotty Douglas, do
yuh reckon? That&#8217;s him, all right. I could tell
him on horseback ten mile off. He rides like a
Mormon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom grunted. His boys, he had long ago discovered,
were very apt to find some excuse for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
changing the subject whenever he mentioned the
past which had not held their arrogant young
selves. Tom resented the attitude of superior
wisdom which they were prone to assume. They
were pretty smart kids, but if they thought they
were smarter than their dad they sure had a
change of heart coming to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposin&#8217; it is old Scotty. Do you reckon,
Al, I&#8217;ve got you along for a guide, to point out
what my eyes is getting too poor to see? As for
Cheyenne,&#8221; he reverted angrily to the argument,
&#8220;as for Cheyenne, when you&#8217;ve growed to be a
man, you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s just as much the mark of a
fool to go along suspecting everybody as it is to
bank on everybody. You think now it&#8217;s funny to
put the Judas brand on every man you don&#8217;t know.
It ain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a kid&#8217;s trick. Boys git that way
when they begin to sprout hair under their noses.
I been pretty patient with yuh, Al. You&#8217;re growing
up fast, and you&#8217;re feeling your oats. I make
allowances, all kinds. But by the humpin&#8217; hyenas,
don&#8217;t you start in telling me where to head in at
with my own outfit! If you do, I&#8217;ll jest about
wear out a willer switch on yuh!&#8221;</p>
<p>This to a youth almost old enough to vote was
dire insult. Al pulled up his horse. &#8220;Run your
own outfit and be darned to yuh!&#8221; he cried hotly,
and spurred off in the direction of the ranch.</p>
<p>Tom laughed shortly and rolled a cigarette.
&#8220;Thinks now it&#8217;ll bust up the round-up if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
goes,&#8221; he opined. &#8220;Lucky for my kids I ain&#8217;t as
strict as my old dad was; they wouldn&#8217;t have any
hide left, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up loped Aleck Douglas then, riding stiff-legged,
his bony elbows jerking awkwardly with
the motion of his horse, a rusty black vest dangling
open under his coat which flapped in the wind.
That the Douglas wrath rode with him Tom saw
from the corner of his eye and gave no sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Tom casually and drew a match
along the stamped fork of his saddle. &#8220;You&#8217;re
quite a stranger.&#8221; He lighted his cigarette, holding
his reins lightly in one hand while he did so;
gave the reins a gentle flip to one side and sent
his horse after a cow and calf that showed symptoms
of &#8220;breaking back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister Lorrigan, &#8217;tis aboot a spotted yearlin&#8217;
that I&#8217;ve come to speak with ye. I&#8217;ve found the
hide of her in the brush beneath yon hill, and the
brand is cut from it. But I wad swear to the hide
wi&#8217;out the brand. &#8217;Twas a yearlin&#8217; I ken weel,
Mister Lorrigan.&#8221; He rode alongside, and his
close-set little eyes regarded keenly Tom&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;A spotted yearling with the brand cut out,
hey? That looks kinda bad. Have you got the
hide with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no got the hide wi&#8217; me, but I ken weel
whaur it lies, Mister Lorrigan, and I thinkit so do
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm-m. You&#8217;d ought to of brought it along.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
Tom&#8217;s glance went out toward the herd and the
cattle lumbering toward it far and near. &#8220;The
range is plumb lousy with spotted yearlings,
Scotty. What do you expect me to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Douglas face worked spasmodically before
he spoke. &#8220;I expect ye, Mr. Lorrigan, to pay for
yon beastie. I ken weel ye could name the mon
that stickit the knife in her throat. An&#8217; she made
fine eatin&#8217;, I have na doot. But &#8217;tis the law, Mister
Lorrigan, that a mon should pay for the meat
he consumes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning, of course, that you think I&#8217;m feeding
Douglas meat to my outfit. Don&#8217;t you think
you&#8217;re kinda hasty? I kill a beef about every three
or four days in round-up time. The boys work
hard and they eat hard. And they eat NL beef,
Scotty; don&#8217;t overlook that fact. Hides ain&#8217;t
worth anything much, but salt&#8217;s cheap, too. I
ain&#8217;t throwin&#8217; away a dollar when it&#8217;s no trouble
to save it. If you&#8217;re any curious at all, you ride
over to ranch and count all the green hides you
can find. Belle, she&#8217;ll show &#8217;em to you. Take a
look at the brands, and figure it out yourself, I
don&#8217;t know how many you&#8217;ll find, but I&#8217;ll gamble
you a dozen cows against one that you&#8217;ll wonder
what went with all the beef that was in them hides.
Humpin&#8217; hyenas! Ain&#8217;t I got cattle enough of
my own, without rustlin&#8217; off my neighbors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye. Ye ha&#8217; cattle, Mister Lorrigan; I ken
weel ye should no&#8217; be put to it for a wee bit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
meat&ndash;&ndash;but I ken weel yon spotty yearlin&#8217; was mine.
I ken ye&#8217;ve been campin&#8217; thereabout&ndash;&ndash;and it wad
seem, Mister Lorrigan, that the salt was no sa
plentifu&#8217; when the spotty yearlin&#8217; was kilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The downright foolhardiness of the Douglas
wrath held Tom&#8217;s hand,&ndash;&ndash;though of a truth that
hand trembled and crept backward. Nor was
Aleck Douglas nearsighted; he saw the movement
and his bearded underlip met his shaven underlip
in a straight line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye do weel to be reachin&#8217; for the gun, Mister
Lorrigan. I dinna carry aye weapon save the
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom flushed. &#8220;Blame your oatmeal soul, if I
reached for my gun, you wouldn&#8217;t be telling me
about it!&#8221; he exploded. &#8220;Carry the truth, do
yuh? You&#8217;ve got to show me where you keep it,
then. If you wasn&#8217;t an old man&ndash;&ndash;and a darn fool
on top of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis no brave to cover shame wi&#8217; bitter words,
Tam Lorrigan. &#8217;Tis the way of ye to bluster and
bully until the neighbors all are affrighted to face
ye and yere ill deeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toward them clattered two riders hotly pursuing
a lean, long-legged steer with a wide spread of
horns and a gift of speed that carried him forging
past the disputants. Tom wheeled mechanically
and gave chase, leaving the Douglas wrath to wax
hotter or to cool if it would. It was a harsh accusation
that Aleck Douglas had made, and that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
did make it seemed to prove that he had what he
considered very good evidence that he was right.
Tom was well schooled in troubles of that kind.
He did not take the matter so indifferently as
Douglas believed.</p>
<p>Duke and Mel Wilson, riding hard, came upon
Tom just as he had roped and thrown the steer in
a shallow draw that hid them from the level where
Aleck Douglas waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; Tom beckoned them close. &#8220;Old
Douglas says there&#8217;s a hide in the willows this side
of Squaw Butte, with the brand cut out; a spotted
yearling, and he claims it&#8217;s his and he can swear
to it without the brand. I don&#8217;t know a darn
thing about it. Nobody does in this outfit; I&#8217;ll
stake all I&#8217;ve got on that. But he&#8217;s on the fight&ndash;&ndash;and
a mule&#8217;s a sheep alongside him when he&#8217;s got
his back up. He left the hide where he found it.
Haze this steer and ride over there and see what
there is to his talk. If you find a hide cach&eacute;d in
the willows, put it outa sight. We don&#8217;t want any
rustling scraps started on this range; that&#8217;s bad
medicine always. If he can&#8217;t produce any hide,
he can&#8217;t start anything but talk&ndash;&ndash;and talk&#8217;s
cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few moments later they came tearing up out
of the draw, the steer running strong, the three
riders still hotly pursuing. Duke and Mel rushed
it on to the herd, and Tom dropped out of the race
and came along across to where Douglas wrath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
had not cooled but had smoldered and waited for
the wind of opposition to fan it to flame again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you still mournin&#8217; over your spotty
yearlin&#8217;?&#8221; Tom called. &#8220;You must have more
time than you know what to do with to-day. Us,
we have to <i>work</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s to the round-up ye&#8217;re going, then I&#8217;ll
ride wi&#8217; ye, Tom Lorrigan. I&#8217;m a fair mon and
I wush na ill to my neighbors. But I canna
twiddle the thumbs whilst others fare well on
Douglas beef.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can ride where you please; it&#8217;s open
range. But if you ride to the herd I&#8217;ll show you
forty yearlings that I&#8217;ll bet are dead ringers for
the one that you claim was killed. I never seen
that hide neither, unless maybe when the critter
was using it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I don&#8217;t want any trouble with yuh,
Scotty. But I tell yuh right now I can&#8217;t stand for
much more of this talk about beef rustling.
Thief&#8217;s a pretty hard word to use to a man&#8217;s face&ndash;&ndash;and
get away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a hard mon I&#8217;m usin&#8217; it tae,&#8221; the Douglas
retorted grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Braggin&#8217; about your nerve, are yuh, Scotty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a name, Tam Lorrigan, and &#8217;tisna
Scotty.&#8221; The Douglas face twisted with anger.
&#8220;I will no bandy worrds with ye. &#8217;Tis ill I should
descend to the level o&#8217; them that deespitefully use
me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Deespitefully!&ndash;&ndash;why, humpin&#8217; hyenas! Ain&#8217;t
I letting yuh <i>live</i>? And do yuh reckon any other
man could walk up to me and call me a thief and
live long enough to take it back? Just because
you&#8217;re old, and such a blamed fool you go around
without a gun on yuh, I&#8217;m keepin&#8217; my hands off
you. I call yuh a coward. You wouldn&#8217;t a dared
to come over here with a gun on yuh and talk the
way you&#8217;ve done. You&#8217;ve got me hog-tied. You
know it. And damn yuh, I&#8217;ll fight yuh now with
the law&ndash;&ndash;which is the only way a coward will
fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done a heap of chawin&#8217; around about
the Lorrigans, Scotty. Don&#8217;t think I ain&#8217;t heard
it. Maybe it&#8217;s your religion to backbite yore
neighbors and say what you wouldn&#8217;t dare to say
to their face with a gun on you so we&#8217;d be equal.
I&#8217;ve passed it up. I&#8217;ve considered the source and
let it go. But when you come belly-achin&#8217; around
about me stealin&#8217; a spotty yearlin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;jest as if
there wasn&#8217;t but one on the Black Rim range!&ndash;&ndash;why,
damn it, <i>you&#8217;ll prove it</i>! Do you get that?
You&#8217;ll prove it before a jury, or I&#8217;ll sue yuh for
libel and bust yuh. I don&#8217;t go much on the law,
but by Henry, I&#8217;ll use it on you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Douglas eyes flickered uncertainly, but the
Douglas mouth was unyielding. &#8220;The law can no
be cheatit so easy, Tam Lorrigan. I hae no wush
to send ye tae jail&ndash;&ndash;but ye ken weel that wad be
the penalty for killin&#8217; yon beastie in the willows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
I came to settle the matter fair between neighbors,
and tae warn ye to cease your evil doings on the
range. I wadna see yer woman come tae grief&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can cut out that mercy talk, Scotty. And
don&#8217;t try to bring Belle into this. If it comes to
a showdown, lemme advise you, you&#8217;d better sidestep
Belle. The grief would all be yourn, if you
and Belle lock horns, and I&#8217;m telling yuh so.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the nearest margin of the herd.
Cheyenne, a nameless estray from the Wyoming
ranges, chanced to be holding herd where the two
rode up. At him Tom looked, suspicion for the
moment sharpening his glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can ask this man what he knows about
any spotted hide over by Squaw Butte,&#8221; he invited
the Douglas stiffly. &#8220;He&#8217;s practically a
stranger to the outfit&ndash;&ndash;been here about a month.
Maybe his word&#8217;ll be worth something to yuh&ndash;&ndash;I
dunno. You can ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Douglas rode over to Cheyenne and said what
he had to say. Tom meanwhile held the herd and
meditated on the petty injustices of life&ndash;&ndash;perhaps&ndash;&ndash;and
wished that a real he-man had come at him
the way Douglas had come. It irked Tom much to
be compelled to meet hard words with tolerant derision.
Toleration was not much of a factor in his
life. But since he must be tolerant, he swung his
horse to meet the Douglas when the brief conversation
with Cheyenne was over. The Douglas
head was shaking slowly, owning disappointment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, yuh might as well make the rounds,
Scotty. Go on and ask all the boys. If I asked
&#8217;em myself you might think it was a frame-up.
And when you&#8217;ve made the rounds, take a look
through the herd. The chances are that you&#8217;ll
find your spotty yearlin&#8217; walking around with her
hide on her. And when you&#8217;re plumb through,
you make tracks away from my outfit. My patience
is strainin&#8217; the buttons right now, looking at
your ugly mug. And lemme tell yuh&ndash;&ndash;and you
mark it down in your little red book so yuh won&#8217;t
forget it&ndash;&ndash;after you&#8217;ve peddled your woes to the
hull outfit, you bring in that hide and some proof,
or you get down on them marrow bones and apologize!
I&#8217;m plumb tired of the way you act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aleck Douglas scowled, opened his hard lips to
make a bitter answer and reconsidered. He went
off instead to interview the men, perhaps thinking
that adroit questioning might reveal a weak point
somewhere in their denial.</p>
<p>Tom rode over to Cheyenne. &#8220;Scotty&#8217;s got his
war clothes on,&#8221; he observed carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shore has,&#8221; Cheyenne grinned. &#8220;But that&#8217;s
all right. He didn&#8217;t make nothin&#8217; off me. I never
give him any satisfaction at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s brows pulled together. &#8220;Well, now, if
you know anything about any hide with the brand
cut out, you&#8217;d better come through, Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never said I knowed anything about it. I
guess mebby that&#8217;s why I couldn&#8217;t give him no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
satisfaction.&#8221; Cheyenne still grinned, but he did
not meet Tom&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke kinda queer for a man who don&#8217;t
know nothing, Cheyenne. Did yuh think mebby
it wasn&#8217;t all NL beef you been eating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no. I never meant anything like that at
all. I only said&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight talk don&#8217;t need no explainin&#8217;,
Cheyenne. The Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit shore likes
the taste of its own beef. If any man fails to agree
with that, I want him to speak up right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheyenne pinched out the fire in his cigarette
and flipped the stub away from him. He did not
look at Tom when he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;NL beef shore suits me. I don&#8217;t know about
any other brand. I ain&#8217;t et none to judge by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet your life you ain&#8217;t,&#8221; snapped Tom,
as he turned away. &#8220;When you sample another
brand you won&#8217;t be drawin&#8217; wages with this outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rode away to the wagon, where a fire was
already burning and the branding irons heating.
Cheyenne, with his hat pulled down over his forehead
so that he looked out from under the brim that
shaded his face, watched Tom queerly, a corner of
his lips lifted in a half smile that was not pleasant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
<h3>THEY RIDE AND THEY DO NOT TELL WHERE</h3>
</div>
<p>Aleck Douglas, having questioned the
crew as Tom had suggested, and having inexorably
ridden through the herd&ndash;&ndash;in search of
brands that had been &#8220;worked,&#8221; or for other evidence
of the unlawful acquisition of wealth, rather
than in hope of finding his spotted yearling&ndash;&ndash;rode
away with the parting threat that he would &#8220;gang
to the shuriff and hae a talk wi&#8217; him.&#8221; Tom had
advised him of one or two other destinations where
he hoped the Douglas would arrive without any
delay whatever, and the branding proceeded
rather slowly with the crew three men short.</p>
<p>Duke and Mel Wilson rode in about three o&#8217;clock
with a few cows and calves which they had gleaned
from some brushy draw to cover their real errand.
By the time they had snatched a hasty meal at the
wagon a mile away, and had caught up fresh
horses, the afternoon&#8217;s work was nearly over. A
little earlier than usual, Tom kicked the branding
fire apart, ordered the herd thrown on water and
grazed back to the bed-ground that had been used
during round-up time ever since he could remember,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
and rode slowly toward camp, whither the
lucky ones not on herd were speeding.</p>
<p>Cheyenne, Tom observed, seemed in a greater
hurry than the others, and he beckoned to him a
slim, swarthy-skinned youth who answered to the
euphonious name of Sam Pretty Cow, who was
three-quarters Indian and forgiven the taint for
the ability to ride anything he ever tried to ride,
rope anything he ever swung his loop at, and for
his unfailing good humor which set him far above
his kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheyenne&#8217;s in a hurry to-night, Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Ride hell out of his horse. I dunno,
me.&#8221; Sam grinned amiably at his boss.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would camp on his trail, Sam.
He&#8217;ll maybe ride somewhere to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Uh-huh. You bet,&#8221; acquiesced Sam,
and leaned forward a little, meaning to gallop
after Cheyenne.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute! What did Scotty have to
say, Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him? Talk a lot about spotty yearlin&#8217; he says
is dead. Asking who kills them calf. Search me,
I dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear any talk among the boys about beef rustling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. First I hear is them sour-face asking
me who kills them critter. Me, I dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hear anything about it, Sam, let me
know. Scotty thinks we done it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Uh-huh. Anybody does something
mean, everybody says, &#8216;Damn Lorrigans done it.&#8217;
Too much talk in the Black Rim. Talking under
their hats all the time but no liking to fight them
Lorrigans. Uh-huh. They&#8217;re scared, you bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have something to get scared at, if
they ain&#8217;t careful. I&#8217;m getting tired of it,&#8221; said
Tom gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, you bet!&#8221; agreed Sam, his voice all sympathy.
Then seeing that Tom had no immediate
intention of saying more, he touched his horse with
his long-shanked spurs and hurried on to &#8220;camp
on the trail of Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom had nearly reached camp when Duke came
pounding up behind him, coming from the herd.
Duke set his horse up, in two jumps slowing from
a gallop to a walk. Tom turned his head but he
did not speak. Nor did Duke wait for questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad, we didn&#8217;t find any hide over by Squaw
Butte,&#8221; he announced abruptly. &#8220;Mel and I
hunted every foot of the willows. I saw where a
critter had been killed, all right. There was some
scuffed-out tracks and blood on the ground. But
there wasn&#8217;t any hide. Scotty musta cach&eacute;d it
somewheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scotty claims he left it where he found it, for
evidence,&#8221; Tom said gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darned if I&#8217;d take the blame for other folks&#8217;
rustling,&#8221; Duke declared. &#8220;I wisht he&#8217;d of come
to me with his tale of woe. I&#8217;d a showed him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
where to head in, mighty darned sudden. I&#8217;d of
asked where was his proof; there&#8217;s other cow outfits
in the Black Rim besides the Devil&#8217;s Tooth,
I&#8217;d tell him. And if he didn&#8217;t have mighty darned
good evidence, I&#8217;d of&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I expect you would of tore the earth up
all round him,&#8221; Tom interrupted drily. &#8220;You
boys shore are fighty, all right&ndash;&ndash;with your faces.
What I&#8217;m interested in, is whereabouts you and
Mel hunted. That hide wouldn&#8217;t show up like the
Devil&#8217;s Tooth&ndash;&ndash;understand. And Scotty was
bawling around like a man that&#8217;s been hurt in the
pocket. He found a hide, and if it ain&#8217;t his he
shore thinks it is, and that&#8217;s just about the same.
And we camped over there three days ago. Where
all did you and Mel look?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All over, wherever a hide could be cach&eacute;d.
There ain&#8217;t any over there. Scotty musta dreamt
it&ndash;&ndash;or else he buried it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scotty ain&#8217;t the dreamy kind. Might be possible
that the ones that done the killing went back
and had a burying&ndash;&ndash;which they&#8217;d oughta have
had at the time. I can&#8217;t sabe a man rustling beef
and leaving the hide laying around, unless&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
Tom pulled his eyebrows together in quick suspicion.
&#8220;It kinda looks to me like a frame-up,&#8221; he
resumed from his fresh viewpoint. &#8220;Well, you
and Mel keep it under your hats, Duke. Don&#8217;t
say nothing to any of the boys at all. But if any of
the boys has anything to say, you listen. Scotty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
made the rounds to-day&ndash;&ndash;talked to the whole
bunch. They know all about his spotty yearlin&#8217;,
gol darn him! I&#8217;d like to know if any of &#8217;em has
got any inside dope. There&#8217;s strangers in the outfit
this spring. And, Duke, you kinda keep your
eye on Cheyenne. Al seems to think he ain&#8217;t right&ndash;&ndash;but
Al has got to the suspicious age, when every
man and his dog packs a crime on his conscience.
You kinda stall around and see if Cheyenne lets
slip anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would happen to old Scotty Douglas if
he lost a bunch, for gosh sake? Drop dead, I
reckon,&#8221; grumbled Duke. &#8220;He&#8217;s sure making a
lot of fuss over one measly yearlin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;ve saw bigger fusses made over
smaller matters, son,&#8221; Tom drawled whimsically.
&#8220;I saw two men killed over a nickel in change,
once. It ain&#8217;t the start; it&#8217;s the finish that
counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, looking at it that way, uh course&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only way to look at it, son. Did you
think, maybe, that I hazed you over to find that
hide and bury it, just to keep it from scentin&#8217; up
the scenery? It&#8217;s what I could smell farther
ahead that I was after. If you&#8217;d looked ahead a
little further, maybe you&#8217;d of looked a little closer
in the willers.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this Duke had nothing to say; and presently
he loped on, leaving Tom to ride slowly and turn
the matter of the spotted yearling over and over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
in his mind until he had reached some definite conclusion.</p>
<p>Tom had the name of being a dangerous man,
but he had not earned it by being hasty. His anger
was to be feared because it smoldered long,
rather than because it exploded into quick violence.
He wanted to see the trail ahead of him&ndash;&ndash;and just
now he thought he saw Trouble waiting on the
turn. No Lorrigan had ever ridden the other way
because Trouble waited ahead, but one Lorrigan
at least would advance with his eyes open and his
weapons ready to his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring your proof,&#8221; he had said in effect to
Aleck Douglas, &#8220;or stand trial for libel. Since
you won&#8217;t fight with guns, I&#8217;ll fight you with the
law.&#8221; Very good, if he could be sure that the
Douglas would fail to produce his proof.</p>
<p>Tom knew well enough the reputation he bore in
the Black Rim country. Before the coming of
Belle, and later, of the boys, Tom had done his
share toward earning that reputation. But Belle
and the boys had changed his life far more than
appeared on the surface. They had held his rope
from his neighbors&#8217; cattle, for one thing, though
his neighbors never had credited him with honesty.</p>
<p>It is true that Tom could remember certain incidents
of the round-up that had added to his herd
and brought him a little nearer the million-dollar
mark. Without remorse he remembered, and
knew that any cowman in the country would do the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
same, or worse if he dared. For branding irons
do not always inquire very closely into the parentage
of a calf that comes bouncing up stiff-legged
at the end of a cowpuncher&#8217;s rope. Nor need a
maverick worry very long because he belongs to
no one, so long as cowmen ride the range. Cattle
would always stray into the Black Rim country
from ranges across the mountains, and of these the
Black Rim took its toll. He supposed strange
irons were set now and then on the hide of an NL
animal across the mountains&ndash;&ndash;but the branders
had better not let him catch them at it! On the
other hand, he would see to it that they did not
catch him branding mavericks on his own range.
To Tom that seemed fair enough,&ndash;&ndash;a give-and-take
game of the rangeland. According to Tom&#8217;s code
he was as honest as his neighbors, and that was
honest enough for practical purposes.</p>
<p>It happened that he had not killed Aleck Douglas&#8217;
spotted yearling. And to be accused of the
theft hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, humpin&#8217; hyenas! If I&#8217;d a beefed that
critter, old Scotty wouldn&#8217;t ever have found no
hide to catch me on! What kinda mark does he
think I am! Rustle a beef and leave the hide
laying around? why, any darn fool would know
better than that!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was characteristic of the Lorrigan influence
that when Tom rode into camp every one of the
crew save his own sons quieted a little; not enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
to suggest timidity, but to a degree that told how
well they knew that their master was present.</p>
<p>That master quietly took stock of his men while
they ate their supper and loafed and smoked and
talked. Cheyenne had unobtrusively retired to
the bed tent. With his thumbs pushed down inside
his belt Tom strolled past and slanted a glance inside.
Cheyenne was squatted on his heels shaving
with cold lather and a cracked looking-glass
propped against a roll of bedding, and a razor
which needed honing. In turning his head to look
at Tom he nicked his chin and while he stopped
the bleeding with a bit of old newspaper the size
of a small finger-nail he congratulated himself in
the mistaken belief that Tom had not seen him at
all.</p>
<p>Cheyenne did not know Tom very well, else he
would have taken it for granted that Tom not only
had seen him, but had also made a guess at his
reason for shaving in the middle of the week.</p>
<p>Tom walked on, making a mental tally of the
girls within riding distance from camp. Jennie
Miller was reported engaged to an AJ man, and
besides, she lived too far away and was not pretty
enough to be worth the effort of a twenty-five mile
ride just to hear her play hymns distressingly on
an organ with a chronic squeak in one pedal.
There was Alice Boyle at the AJ, and there was
Mary Hope Douglas, who was growing to be quite
a young lady,&ndash;&ndash;pretty good-looking, too, if she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
wouldn&#8217;t peel her hair back so straight and tight.
Mary Hope Douglas, Tom decided, was probably
the girl. It struck Tom as significant that she
should be the daughter of the man who mourned
the loss of the yearling. He had not reached the
rear of the tent before he decided that he himself
would do a little riding that night. He caught and
saddled Coaley, his own pet saddle horse that had
never carried any man save Tom&ndash;&ndash;never would,
so long as Tom had anything to say about it&ndash;&ndash;and
set off toward the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch. Cheyenne
ducked his head under the tent flap when he heard
the sound of hoof beats passing close, saw that it
was his boss, noted the direction he was taking, and
heaved a sigh of relief. While he labored with the
knot in his handkerchief which must be tied exactly
right before he would leave the tent, Cheyenne
had been composing a reason for leaving camp.
Now he would not need a reason, and he grinned
while he plastered his hair down in a sleek, artistically
perfect scallop over his right eyebrow.
Tom was going to the home ranch,&ndash;&ndash;to round up
Al, very likely. He would be gone all night and he
would not know how many of his men rode abroad
that night.</p>
<p>So presently Cheyenne saddled the freshest
horse in his string and loped off, making an insulting
sign with one hand when the boys wished him
luck with the girl and offered to go along and talk
religion with &#8220;feyther&#8221; just to help him out.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>Very soon after that Sam Pretty Cow drifted
away, and no one noticed his absence. Sam Pretty
Cow&#8217;s wanderings never did attract much attention.
He was Injun, and Injuns have ways
strange to white men. For instance, he did not
sleep in the tent, but spread his blankets under
whatever shelter he could find within hailing distance
from the others. He was always around
when he was wanted, and that seemed to be all that
was expected of him. Sleep settled on the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth round-up camp, and the night guard sang
to the cattle while they rode round and round the
herd, and never dreamed that this night was not
as other nights had been.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIX</h2>
<h3>BELLE MEETS AN EMERGENCY IN HER OWN WAY</h3>
</div>
<p>A Meadow Lark, his conscience comfortable
after a generous breakfast of big and little
worms carried to his mate hidden away under a
thick clump of rabbit weed down by the creek,
spread rigid wings and volplaned to the crooked
post beside the corral gate, folded his feathers
snug and tilted his head aslant. <i>&#8220;Cler, cler, cler,
cler-ee, cler-ee!&#8221;</i> he sang, and perked a wary eye
toward the low-roofed stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hear you, you sassy little sinner! I
wouldn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have the nerve, after what
you&#8217;ve done to my radishes. I&#8217;m sure going to
mix with you, if you&ndash;&ndash;Rosa! Lift a heel at me
and you die! Stand over&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you try squeezing
me against the wall, or I&#8217;ll take my quirt to
you! Get over there, before I brain you! Hay-ah-h,
you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>From the sounds one would imagine that a bear,
two lions and a mule had come to handgrips in
the stable, and that a woman of the Amazons was
battling with them all. The meadow lark knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
better. This was his second season on the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth ranch, and he knew that Belle Lorrigan was
merely harnessing her pinto team in the stable, and
that nothing out of the ordinary was taking place.
Being a wise bird as well as an inquisitive one, he
fluttered up to the ridge-pole of the roof and from
that sanctuary listened beady-eyed to the customary
tumult.</p>
<p>Certain staccato epithets meant merely that Subrosa
was objecting to the crupper. A sudden
stamping testified that Belle had approached Rosa
with the bridle. A high-keyed, musical voice
chanting man-size words of an intimidating nature
followed which proved that the harnessing was
progressing as well as could be expected. Then
came a lull, and the meadow lark tilted forward
expectantly, his head turned sidewise to see what
came next.</p>
<p>First came Belle Lorrigan, walking backward,
a shot-loaded quirt raised admonishingly to the
chin of Subrosa who walked stiff-legged and reluctant,
his white-lashed, blue eyes rolling fearsomely,
his nostrils belling in loud snorts of protest. A
complexity of emotions stirred Subrosa. Afraid
to lunge forward, hating to walk circumspectly,
eager for the race yet dreading the discipline of
rein and whip, Subrosa yielded perforce to the inevitable.
As his heels flicked over the low doorsill
he swung round and landed one final kick
against the log wall, threw up his head in anticipation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
of the quirt, stepped on a dragging trace chain
and jumped as though it was a rattler.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of that, you cantankerous brute! One of
these days I&#8217;m going to just naturally brain you,
Sub. I&#8217;m getting good and tired of this circus
business. You settle down, now, and act human,
or&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Subrosa kicked at the trace and flipped it up so
that it struck him smartly on the rump. He
jumped straight forward at Belle, who dodged and
landed the quirt none too gently on his nose. Subrosa
sat down violently, and Belle straightway
kicked him in the paunch by way of hinting that
she preferred him standing. Then they had it
out, rampaging all over the round-pole corral until
Belle, breathing a bit fast but sparkly-eyed and
victorious, led Subrosa through the gate and up to
the post where she snubbed him fast. She was
turning to go after Rosa when a young voice called
to her anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Lorrigan! Quick, I&#8217;m in a hurry.
I mustn&#8217;t stay, because they&#8217;ll be here in a little
while. But they&#8217;re coming by the road and I came
down the trail, and that gave me time. I can&#8217;t
take any more music lessons, Mrs. Lorrigan.
Father is that angry wi&#8217; your husband&ndash;&ndash;and oh,
Mrs. Lorrigan! If you have any hide that isna
your own, ye should hide it away at once! Because
the shuriff&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle laid her palms on her hips and stared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
blankly up at Mary Hope, who sat nervously on
old Rab at the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, child! My hide is my own&ndash;&ndash;and at
that it&#8217;s pretty well hidden. What about the sheriff?
What&#8217;s he got to say about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the stealing, Mrs. Lorrigan. Father has
the shuriff wi&#8217; him, and they are going to search
the ranch for the hides&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord! <i>What</i> hides?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The hides of my father&#8217;s cattle. And if you
have any, put them away quick, where the shuriff
canna find them, Mrs. Lorrigan! It&#8217;s ill I should
go against my father, but you have been so good
to me with the music lessons, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let the music lessons bother you, Hope.
And I guess we&#8217;re entitled to all the cowhides
we&#8217;ve got on the place, if that&#8217;s what you mean.
What do you think we are&ndash;&ndash;thieves, Hope Douglas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dinna say it. I only came to warn ye, so
that you may have time tae put your hides way oot
o&#8217; their sicht when they come. I dinna want that
your husband should go to prison, Mrs. Lorrigan.
But father is that angry&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, say! Let me tell you something, Hope.
If there&#8217;s any talk of stealing and prison for the
Lorrigans, your dad had better keep outa my
Tom&#8217;s sight. And outa mine,&#8221; she added grimly.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be no searching for anything on this
ranch when my Tom&#8217;s not here to see what goes on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
You better go back and tell your dad I said it. If
you don&#8217;t and he brings the sheriff on here, don&#8217;t
blame me if somebody gets hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s the law they&#8217;re bringing on ye!
Ye canna go contrary to the law!&#8221; Mary Hope&#8217;s
voice quavered with fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, can&#8217;t I!&#8221; Belle gave her head a tilt.
&#8220;You beat it, while the going&#8217;s good. I hear
voices up on the road. If you don&#8217;t want your dad
to come and catch you here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>That settled it. Terror drove Mary Hope into
the Devil&#8217;s Tooth trail at Rab&#8217;s best pace, which
was a stiff-legged lope. Her last glance backward
showed her Belle Lorrigan taking her six-shooter
belt off the buckboard seat and buckling it around
her waist so that the gun hung well forward.
Mary Hope shuddered and struck Rab with the
quirt.</p>
<p>Belle had led Rosa from the stable and was cautiously
fastening the neck yoke in place when the
sheriff and Aleck Douglas rode around the corner
of the stable. Rosa shied and snorted and reared,
and Belle used the rein-ends for a whiplash until
Rosa decided that she would better submit to authority
and keep her hide whole. She stood fairly
quiet after that, with little nipping dance-steps in
one spot, while Belle fastened buckles and snaps
and trace chains. Subrosa, having had his tantrum,
contented himself with sundry head-shakings
and snorts. When the team was &#8220;hooked up&#8221; to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Belle&#8217;s satisfaction, she tied them both firmly to
the corral with short ropes, and finally turned her
attention to her visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Mr. Douglas? Fine day we&#8217;re having,&#8221;
she greeted the dour Scotchman amiably.</p>
<p>The sheriff coughed behind his hand, looked sidelong
at his companion, rode a step or two nearer
to Belle, swung a leg over the cantle of his saddle.
Perhaps he expected Aleck Douglas to introduce
him, but he did not wait for the formality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lorrigan, I&#8217;m sheriff of the county,&#8221; he
began ingratiatingly, when his two feet were on the
ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are?&#8221; Belle flashed a row of very white
teeth. &#8220;You sure don&#8217;t look it. I&#8217;d have taken
you for a regular human being.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Douglas, here, would like to take a look at
some hides Mr. Lorrigan has got curing. He
thinks possibly&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis useless to cover the truth wi&#8217; saft words,
shuriff,&#8221; Douglas interrupted glumly. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
stolen cattle we are tracing, and &#8217;tis here we wad
look for the hides of them. I hae guid reason&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find my husband at the round-up. Before
you do any searching, you had better go and
have a talk with him. When he&#8217;s gone strangers
don&#8217;t go prowling around this ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have our talk with him after we&#8217;ve taken
a look around,&#8221; the sheriff amended, grinning a
little. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a matter of form&ndash;&ndash;nothing you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
need to object to, one way or the other. I don&#8217;t
suppose we&#8217;ll find anything&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose you will. Not unless you
find it on the road back. I hate to seem unfriendly,
but I&#8217;ll just have to ask you to crawl on your horse
and go see Tom about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, we don&#8217;t want any unpleasantness at all,
Mrs. Lorrigan. But this man has swore out a
warrant&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! What he does never did interest me
one way or the other, and does not now. I&#8217;m telling
you there&#8217;ll be no snooping around here while
Tom&#8217;s away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, now!&#8221; The sheriff rather prided
himself on his ability to &#8220;handle folks peaceable,&#8221;
as he expressed it. He injected a little more of the
oil of persuasiveness into his voice. It was his
standard recipe for avoiding trouble with a
woman. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think for a minute I&#8217;d take
advantage of his absence, Mrs. Lorrigan? Nothing
like that at all. We just want to see if a certain
cowhide is here. If it isn&#8217;t, then we won&#8217;t
need to bother Tom at all, maybe. Get down, Mr.
Douglas, and we&#8217;ll just have a look around. Mrs.
Lorrigan ain&#8217;t going to make no objections to
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle smiled. &#8220;Oh, yes, she is. She&#8217;s going to
do quite a lot of objecting. You better stay right
where you are, Scotty. You&#8217;re a heap safer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff began to lose patience. &#8220;Now, look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
here, Mrs. Lorrigan! You&#8217;re dealing with the law,
you know. We can&#8217;t have any nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t have,&#8221; Belle assured him placidly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to beat into your
head. Why, good Lord! Can&#8217;t you take the hint
and see I&#8217;m trying not to have any trouble with
yuh? I don&#8217;t want to have to <i>run</i> you off the
ranch&ndash;&ndash;but as you say, there&#8217;s not going to be
any nonsense. I said, <i>go</i>. I&#8217;m waiting to see if
you&#8217;ve got sense enough to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sa-ay! Just look here now! Do you know
it&#8217;s a State&#8217;s prison offense to resist an officer!&#8221;
The sheriff&#8217;s face was growing red.</p>
<p>Belle laughed. &#8220;Sure. But I&#8217;m not. You&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re
irresistible! And I don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re an
officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>This went over the sheriff&#8217;s head and was
wasted, though Aleck Douglas pulled down his
mouth at the corners as though he was afraid he
might smile if he were not careful.</p>
<p>The sheriff took up his bridle reins, preparing to
lead his horse over to a post and tie him. He
glanced at Belle and saw that she had a six-shooter
in her hand and a glitter in her eyes. Quite naturally
he hesitated. Then, at a perfectly plain signal
from the gun, he turned his palms toward her
at a level with his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tie up. Crawl into the saddle and
drift.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a search warrant&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You can keep it and show it to Tom. And get
off this ranch just as quick as that horse can take
you. I&#8217;ll have you both arrested for trespassing.
I&#8217;m not taking your word for anything,
you see. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t know anything about your warrant&ndash;&ndash;hey,
Riley!&#8221; This to the cook, who came,
taking steps as long as his legs would let him,
and swinging a damp dishcloth in one moist red
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Riley, here&#8217;s a man claims he&#8217;s the sheriff and
that he&#8217;s got a warrant to search the ranch. I
don&#8217;t believe a word of it, and I&#8217;ve ordered him off
the place. I wouldn&#8217;t for the world resist an officer
of the law&ndash;&ndash;put your hands up a little higher,
Mr. Man!&ndash;&ndash;but when Tom ain&#8217;t home no stranger
is going to come snooping around here if I can stop
him. Ain&#8217;t that right, Riley?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Belle,&#8221; Riley acquiesced, working
his oversized Adam&#8217;s apple convulsively.
(Riley, by the way, would just as readily have approved
of murder if Belle had asked for his approval.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a witness that I&#8217;m from Missouri.
I&#8217;ve told this man to go tell his troubles to Tom.
If he&#8217;s honest he&#8217;ll do it. If he don&#8217;t go in about
ten seconds, I&#8217;m going to throw a bullet through
his hat. <i>Then</i> if he hangs around, I shall shoot
him in his left leg just about six inches above the
knee. I can do it, can&#8217;t I, Riley?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, you shore can, Belle!&#8221; Riley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
nodded his head emphatically. &#8220;If you say six,
I&#8217;d shore gamble a year&#8217;s wages it won&#8217;t be five,
or seven. Six inches above his knee goes, if you
say six.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;m just defending the ranch when
Tom&#8217;s gone. You hear me, Mr. Man. Now, you
git!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff turned and opened his mouth to protest,
and Belle shot the promised bullet through his
hat crown. The sheriff ducked and made a wild
scramble for the stirrup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open your mouth again and I&#8217;ll be awfully
tempted to shoot that crooked tooth out of it,&#8221;
Belle observed. &#8220;And in ten seconds, remember,
you&#8217;re going to get&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff still had two of the ten seconds to
spare when he left, Aleck Douglas following him
glumly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s him, all right. It&#8217;s the sheriff, Belle,&#8221;
Riley informed her, while they watched the two
clatter up the road to where the real grade began.
&#8220;What&#8217;s eatin&#8217; on &#8217;em? Likely he did have a
search warrant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can use it, after I&#8217;m through. Old
Scotty is trailing some rustled stock, they claim.
They came here looking for hides. You keep
an eye out, Riley, and see if they keep going. I
guess they will&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;ll go after Tom. I&#8217;m
going to have a look at those cowhides in the old
shed.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Better let me,&#8221; Riley offered. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t any
job for a woman nohow. You watch the trail and
I&#8217;ll look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle would not even consider the proposition.
The Lorrigan reputation never had troubled her
much,&ndash;&ndash;but it sent her now to the shed where hides
were kept stored until the hide buyer made his
next annual visit through the country. She did
not believe that she would find any brand save the
various combinations of the NL monogram, but she
meant to make sure before any stranger was given
access to the place.</p>
<p>The <i>job</i> was neither easy nor pleasant, but
she did it thoroughly. Riley, roosting meditatively
on the top rail of the corral where he
could watch the road down the bluff, craned his
long neck inquiringly toward her when she returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but NL stuff, just as I thought,&#8221; said
Belle, holding her hands as far away from her face
as possible. &#8220;I knew Tom wouldn&#8217;t have any
stolen hides on the place&ndash;&ndash;but it was best to make
sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No ma&#8217;am, he wouldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m shore surprised
they&#8217;d come and try to find any. Looks bad to
me, Belle. Looks to me like somebody is shore
tryin&#8217; to start somethin&#8217;. There&#8217;s plenty in the
Black Rim would like to see Tom railroaded to
the pen&ndash;&ndash;plenty. Looks to me like they&#8217;re aimin&#8217;
to pin something on him. No, sir, I don&#8217;t like it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
Uh course,&#8221; he went on, letting himself loose-jointedly
to the ground, &#8220;they couldn&#8217;t get nothing on
Tom&ndash;&ndash;not unless they framed something. But I
wouldn&#8217;t put it a-past &#8217;em to do it. No, ma&#8217;am, I
wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your bread&#8217;s burning, Riley. I can smell it.
Don&#8217;t you never think they&#8217;ll frame on Tom.
They may try it&ndash;&ndash;but that&#8217;s as far as they&#8217;ll get.
They don&#8217;t want to start anything with the Lorrigans!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I left the oven door open. She ain&#8217;t
burning to hurt. Yuh see, Scotty Douglas, he&#8217;s religious
and he don&#8217;t never pack a gun. Them
kind&#8217;s bad to tangle up with; awful bad. There
ain&#8217;t nothing much a man can do with them religious
birds. Them not being armed, you can&#8217;t
shoot&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s murder. And that kinda ties a man&#8217;s
hands, as yuh might say. They always take advantage
of it, invariable. No, ma&#8217;am, it looks
bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll look worse&ndash;&ndash;for them that tries any
funny business with this outfit,&#8221; Belle assured
him. &#8220;Go along and &#8217;tend to your baking. You
know I hate burnt bread. I&#8217;m going to drive over
and see what they&#8217;re up to.&#8221;</p>
<p>She untied Rosa and Subrosa, and because she
was in a hurry she permitted Riley to hold them by
the bits while she climbed in, got the lines firmly in
one hand and her blacksnake in the other. Not
often did she deign to accept assistance, and Riley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
was all aquiver with gratified vanity at this mark
of her favor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn &#8217;em loose&ndash;&ndash;and get to that bread!&#8221; she
cried, and circled the pintos into the road. &#8220;You,
Sub! Cut that out, now&ndash;&ndash;settle down! Rosa!
Stead-dy, I ain&#8217;t any Ben Hur pulling off a chariot
race, remember!&#8221;</p>
<p>At a gallop they took the first sandy slope of
the climb, and Belle let them go. They were tough&ndash;&ndash;many&#8217;s
the time they had hit the level on top of
the ridge without slowing to a walk on the way up.
They had no great load to pull, and if it pleased
them to lope instead of trot, Belle would never
object.</p>
<p>As she sat jouncing on the seat of a buckboard
with rattly spokes in all of the four wheels and a
splintered dashboard where Subrosa landed his
heels one day when he had backed before he kicked,
one felt that she would have made a magnificent
charioteer. Before she had gone half a mile her
hair was down and whipping behind her like a
golden pennant. Her big range hat would have
gone sailing had it not been tied under her chin
with buckskin strings. Usually she sang as she
hurtled through space, but to-day the pintos missed
her voice.</p>
<p>Five miles out on the range she overtook the
sheriff and Aleck Douglas riding to the round-up.
Aleck Douglas seldom rode faster than a jogging
trot, and the sheriff was not particularly eager for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
his encounter with Tom Lorrigan. For that matter,
no sheriff had ever been eager to encounter a
Lorrigan. The Lorrigan family had always been
counted a hazard in the office of the sheriff, though
of a truth the present generation had remained
quiescent so far and the law had not heretofore
reached its arm toward them.</p>
<p>The two men looked back, saw Belle coming and
parted to let her pass. Belle yelled to her team
and went by with never a glance toward either,
and the two stared after her without a word until
she had jounced down into a shallow draw and
up the other side, the pintos never slowing their
lope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m darned!&#8221; ejaculated the sheriff.
His name, by the way, was Perry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard
tell of Belle Lorrigan drivin&#8217; hell-whoopin&#8217; over
the country with a team of bronks, but I kinda
thought they was stretching the truth. I guess
not, though, if that&#8217;s a sample.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman hersel&#8217; is no so bad. &#8217;Tis the men
folk that are black wi&#8217; sin. Drinkin&#8217;, swearin&#8217;,
gamblin&#8217; thieves they be, and &#8217;tis well they should
be taught a lesson.&#8221; The Douglas head wagged
self-righteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it would be a good idea to go back and
search the ranch now, while she&#8217;s gone.&#8221; The
sheriff pulled up, considering. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want
any trouble with her; I never do quarrel with a
woman if I can get around it any way. She&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
holy terror. I guess I&#8217;ll just ride back and take
a look at them hides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aleck Douglas eyed him sardonically, thinking
perhaps of the black-edged bullet hole that showed
plainly in the sheriff&#8217;s hat-crown.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a deal safer wi&#8217; the woman oot of the
way,&#8221; he agreed drily.</p>
<p>The sheriff nodded and turned back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
<h3>THE NAME</h3>
</div>
<p>Tom Lorrigan may have seen bigger fusses
made over smaller matters than the hide of a
spotty yearlin&#8217;, but his boys never had.</p>
<p>No country is so isolated that gossip cannot find
it out. The story of the spotted yearling went
speeding through the country. Men made thin
excuses to ride miles out of their way that they
might air their opinions and hear some fresh bit
of news, some conjecture that grew to a rumor and
was finally repeated broadcast as truth. Children
cringed and wept while necks were scrubbed relentlessly,
for a fever of &#8220;visiting&#8221; attacked the
women of the range. Miles they would travel to
visit a neighbor. And there they talked and talked
and talked, while the guest in neighborly fashion
dried the dinner dishes for the hostess in hot, fly-infested
kitchens.</p>
<p>Aleck Douglas, infuriated by the contemptuous
attitude which Tom had taken toward him and his
spotty yearling, and by his failure to find any incriminating
evidence on the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
swore to a good many suspicions which he called
facts, and had Tom arrested. The sheriff had
taken two deputies along with him, because he
fully expected that the Lorrigans would &#8220;go on the
warpath&#8221; as Belle had done. He was vastly astonished
and somewhat chagrined when Tom gave
a snort, handed over his gun, and turned to one
of his boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Al,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;you go ahead with the round-up
while I go in and fix this up. May take a few
days&ndash;&ndash;depends on the gait I can get &#8217;em to travel.
I&#8217;ll have to rustle me a lawyer, too. But you know
what to do; keep &#8217;er moving till I get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Rim country talked and chortled and surmised,
and wondered what made Tom so darned
meek about it. They did not accuse him of any
lack of nerve; being a Lorrigan, his nerve could
scarcely be questioned. Opinion was about evenly
divided. A few declared that Tom had something
up his sleeve, and there would be a killing yet.
Others insisted that Tom knew when he was backed
into a corner. Old Scotty Douglas had him dead
to rights, they said, and Tom knew better than to
run on the rope. Men and women assumed the
gift of prophecy, and all prophesied alike. Tom
Lorrigan would go &#8220;over the road&#8221;; for how long
they could only guess according to their secret
hopes. Some predicted a fifteen-year term for
Tom. Others thought that he might get off
lightly&ndash;&ndash;say with five or six years. They based
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
their opinion on the fact that men have been sent
to the penitentiary for fifteen years, there to repent
of stealing a calf not yet past the age of prime
veal. And it is not so long since men were hanged
for stealing a horse; witness Tom&#8217;s brother, who
would surely have been lynched had he not been
shot. Witness also divers other Lorrigans whose
careers had been shortened by their misdeeds.</p>
<p>Much of the talk was peddled to Tom and the
boys under the guise of friendship. Having lived
all of his life in the Black Rim country, Tom knew
how much the friendship was worth, knew that the
Black Rim folk had drawn together like a wolf
pack, and were waiting only until he was down before
they rushed in to rend him and his family.
Old grudges were brought out and aired secretly.
It would go hard with the Lorrigan family if Tom
were found guilty. Although he sensed the covert
malice behind the smiles men gave him, he would
not yield one inch from his mocking disparagement
of the whole affair. He laid down a law or
two to his boys, and bade them hold their tongues
and go their way and give no heed to the clacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The show ain&#8217;t over till the curtain&#8217;s down for
good,&#8221; he said, borrowing a phrase from Belle.
&#8220;We got a long time yet to live in the Black Rim.
We&#8217;ll be right here when the smoke lifts. Hang
and rattle now, and keep your mouths shut. This
here&#8217;s the law-sharp&#8217;s job. I&#8217;m payin&#8217; him darn
good money for it, too. When he&#8217;s through, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
we&#8217;ll play. But mark this down in yore little red
book, boys: The less yuh say right now, the
stronger we can play the game when we&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do railroad yuh, dad, leave it to us.
They&#8217;ll be a sorry looking bunch when we&#8217;re
through,&#8221; said Lance, and meant every word of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t railroad me.&#8221; Tom snorted and
laughed his contempt of the whole affair. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
ever used the law to fight with before&ndash;&ndash;but
shucks! When a scrap gets outside of gun range,
one club&#8217;s about the same as another to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Optimism is a good thing, but it does not altogether
serve, as Tom discovered at the trial.</p>
<p>Evidence was produced which astonished him.
For instance, an AJ man had seen him riding over
by Squaw Butte, on the night after Douglas had
accused him of stealing the spotted yearling. The
AJ man seemed embarrassed at his sudden prominence
in the case, and kept turning his big range
hat round and round on one knee as he sat in the
chair sacred to those who bore witness to the guilt
or innocence of their fellow men in Black Rim
country. He did not often look up, and when he
did he swallowed convulsively, as though something
stuck in his throat. But his story sounded
matter-of-fact and honest.</p>
<p>He had ridden past Squaw Butte the night after
Tom Lorrigan was accused by Douglas. Yes, he
knew it was that night, because next day he heard
about the fuss over at Devil&#8217;s Tooth. He had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
on his way from Jumpoff and had cut across country
because he was late. There was a moon, and
he had seen a man riding across an open space between
the creek and the willows. The man had
gone in among the willows. The AJ man had not
thought much about it, though he did wonder a
little, too. It was late for a man to be riding
around on the range.</p>
<p>When he reached the place, he saw a man ride
out of the brush farther along, into clear moonlight.
It was Tom Lorrigan; yes, he was sure of
that. He knew the horse that Tom was riding.
It was a big, shiny black that always carried its
head up; a high-stepping horse that a man could
recognize anywhere. No, he didn&#8217;t know of any
other horse in the country just like it. He admitted
that if he hadn&#8217;t been sure of the horse he
would not have been sure it was Tom. He did not
think Tom saw him at all. He was riding along
next the bank, in the shadow. He had gone on
home, and the next day he heard that Scotty Douglas
claimed the Lorrigans had rustled a yearling
from him.</p>
<p>Later, Tom&#8217;s lawyer asked him why he had not
spoken to Tom. The AJ man replied that he
didn&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;he wasn&#8217;t very close; not close
enough for talking unless he hollered.</p>
<p>That was all very well, and Black Rim perked
its ears, thinking that the case looked bad for Tom.
Very bad indeed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>But Tom&#8217;s lawyer proved very adroitly that the
AJ man had not been in Jumpoff at the time he
claimed. He had been with his own outfit, and if
he had ridden past Squaw Butte that night he must
have gone out from the ranch and come back
again. Which led very naturally to the question,
Why?</p>
<p>On the other hand, why had Tom Lorrigan ridden
to Squaw Butte that night? He himself explained
that later on. He said that he had gone
over to see if there was any hide in the willows as
Douglas had claimed. He had not found any.</p>
<p>Thus two men admitted having been in the neighborhood
of the stolen hide on that night. Tom&#8217;s
lawyer was quick to seize the coincidence, and make
the most of it. Why, he asked mildly, might not
the AJ outfit have stolen the yearling? What was
the AJ man doing there? Why not suspect him
of having placed the hide in the crevice where it
had later been found? That night the hide had
been removed from the willows where Douglas
had first discovered it. Douglas had gone back
the next day after it, and it had been missing. It
was not until several days later that he had found
it in the crevice. Why assume that Tom Lorrigan
had removed it?</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d set out to cach&eacute; that hide,&#8221; Tom here
interposed, &#8220;I&#8217;d have buried it. Only a darn fool
would leave evidence like that laying around in
sight.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>For this the court reprimanded him, but he had
seen several of the jury nod their heads, unconsciously
agreeing with him. And although his remark
was never put on record, it stuck deep in the
minds of the jury and had its influence later on.
They remembered that the Lorrigans were no
fools, and they considered the attempt at concealing
the hide a foolish one&ndash;&ndash;not to say childish.</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s lawyer did not argue openly that a conspiracy
had been hatched against Tom Lorrigan,
but he so presented the case in his closing argument
to the jury that each man believed he saw an angle
to the affair which the defense had overlooked.
It appeared to the jury to be a &#8220;frame-up.&#8221; For
instance, why had Cheyenne, a Lorrigan man, ridden
over to the Douglas ranch and remained outside
by the corral for a long time, talking with
Aleck Douglas, before he went inside to call on the
Douglas girl? Sam Pretty Cow impassively testified
to that. He had been riding over to see a
halfbreed girl that worked for the Blacks, and he
had cut through the Douglas ranch to save time.
He saw Cheyenne&#8217;s horse at the corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, I dunno what she&#8217;s doin&#8217; on that place.
Cheyenne, he&#8217;s in camp when I&#8217;m go. I&#8217;m stop by
the haystack. I&#8217;m see Cheyenne talk to Scotty.
That don&#8217;t look good, you bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>A full week the trial lasted, while the lawyers
wrangled over evidence and technicalities, and the
judge ruled out evidence and later ruled it in again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
A full week Tom slept in the county jail,&ndash;&ndash;and for
all their bad reputation, it was the first time a Lorrigan
had lain down behind a bolted door to sleep,
had opened his eyes to see the dawn light painting
the wall with the shadow of bars.</p>
<p>There were nights when his optimism failed
him, when Tom lay awake trying to adjust himself
to the harrying thought that long, caged years
might be his portion. Nights when he doubted the
skill of his &#8220;law-sharp&#8221; to free him from the deadweight
of the Lorrigan reputation and the malice
of his neighbors. Of course, he would fight&ndash;&ndash;to
the last dollar; but there were nights when he
doubted the power of his dollars to save him.</p>
<p>It was during those nights that the lawless blood
of the Lorrigans ran swiftly through the veins of
Tom, who had set himself to win a million honestly.
It was then that he remembered his quiet, law-abiding
years regretfully, as time wasted; a thankless
struggle toward the regard of his fellow men.
Of what avail to plod along the path of uprightness
when no man would point to him and say, &#8220;There
is an honest man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve give me the name, and I ain&#8217;t got the
game,&#8221; cried Tom bitterly, in the quiet of his
cell. &#8220;Whether I go to the pen or whether I
don&#8217;t, they better stand from under. They&#8217;ll sure
know a Lorrigan&#8217;s livin&#8217; in the Black Rim before
I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
<h3>THE GAME</h3>
</div>
<p>At the long table in the living room of the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth ranch Tom Lorrigan sat and sharpened
an indelible pencil with the razor-edged small
blade of his jackknife. On the open space which
Tom had cleared with the sweep of his arm, a
large-sized tablet of glazed and ruled paper, with
George Washington pictured in red and blue and
buff on the cover, received the wood parings from
the pencil. It may have been significant that
Tom was careful in his work and made the pencil
very sharp.</p>
<p>Across the room, Belle swung around on the
piano stool and looked at him. &#8220;Honey, if you&#8217;re
going to make out the order to Montgomery, Ward,
I&#8217;d like to send on for some more music. I&#8217;ve
been going over that new list&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t,&#8221; said Tom, removing his cigarette
from the corner of his mouth and blowing the tiny,
blue-painted shavings off George Washington&#8217;s
face. &#8220;You go ahead and make out the order
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>Belle eyed the pencil-sharpening and sent a keen
glance at Tom&#8217;s face. &#8220;Well, honey, from the way
you&#8217;re squaring up to that tablet, I thought you
was going to send on for a new buckboard and
mower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom bent his head and blew again, gave George
a sardonic grin and turned him face-down on the
table, so that the ruled paper lay ready to his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now I&#8217;m going to figure up what that
dang spotty yearlin&#8217; of old Scotty&#8217;s cost me,&#8221; he
stated grimly. &#8220;And there&#8217;s some other Black
Rimmers I&#8217;ve got a bill against.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope you don&#8217;t try holding your breath till
you collect,&#8221; Belle retorted. &#8220;Honey, you&#8217;d best
leave the Black Rimmers alone. I feel as if we&#8217;d had
enough excitement enough for a while. I wouldn&#8217;t
start anything more right now, if I was you. Every
last one of them is ready to jump on your neck&ndash;&ndash;and
the Lord only knows why, unless it&#8217;s because
you <i>didn&#8217;t</i> steal that darned spotted yearling!
Some folks sure do love to see the other
fellow up to his eyebrows in trouble. They were
sitting there in that courtroom just <i>wishing</i> you
would be sent up. I saw it in their faces, Tom.
And that old rock-hearted Scotchman looked as if
he&#8217;s just lost two bits when the jury said &#8216;Not
guilty.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mh-m&ndash;&ndash;hm-m&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m figuring on
now,&#8221; said Tom, and bent to his problem. &#8220;My
old dad woulda gone out and shot up a few, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
times are changed and we&#8217;re all getting so damn
civilized we&#8217;ve got to stack the cards or quit the
game. Belle, what do you reckon it&#8217;s worth to a
man to be hauled into court and called a cow
thief?&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle&#8217;s lips pressed together. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,
Tom&ndash;&ndash;but I know what it would have cost &#8217;em
if they had sent you over the road. I had a gun
on me, and when that jury foreman stood up to
give the verdict, it was looking him in the eye
through a buttonhole in my coat. Him and Cheyenne
and old Scotty and two or three more would
sure have got theirs, if he hadn&#8217;t said, &#8216;Not
guilty.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord bless yuh, I knew it all the time. Next
time we go to court you&#8217;ll leave the artillery at
home, old girl. I like to got heart failure there
for a minute, till I seen you ease down and lay your
hand in your lap.&#8221; He looked at her and laughed
a little. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a bill of damages against several
of the folks around here, but I ain&#8217;t fool
enough to try and collect with a six-gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>He settled himself to his task, writing at the top
of the page the name of Aleck Douglas and after
that &#8220;Dr.&#8221; A full page he covered with items
set against the names of various neighbors.
When he had finished he folded the paper neatly
and put it away with other important memoranda,
picked up his big gray Stetson and went over to
kiss Belle full on her red lips, and to smooth her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
hair, with a reassuring pat on her plump shoulder
as a final caress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry none about the Black Rimmers,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and don&#8217;t you worry about me.
I&#8217;ve got to ride high, wide and handsome now to
make up the time and money I lost on account of
the spotty yearlin&#8217;, and maybe I won&#8217;t be home so
much. But I ain&#8217;t quarreling with my neighbors,
nor getting into any kind of ruckus whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the stilted, slightly stiff-legged gait born
of long hours in the saddle and of high-heeled riding
boots, he walked unhurriedly to the corral
where the boys were just driving in a herd of
horses.</p>
<p>Few of them showed saddle marks, all of them
snorted and tossed untrimmed manes and tails as
they clattered against the stout poles, circling the
big corral in a cloud of dust and a thunder of hoof
beats. Pulling his hat down over his black brows
to secure it against the wind, Tom climbed the
corral fence and straddled the top rail that he
might scan the herd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good-looking bunch, dad,&#8221; said Al,
reining up beside Tom. &#8220;We had to ride some to
get &#8217;em in&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re sure snuffy. What you going
to do with &#8217;em? Break out a few?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some. Did yuh take notice, Al, that Coaley
come within an ace of sending me over the road?
That there AJ man swore to the horse when he
wouldn&#8217;t never have swore to me, but they all took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
it as a cinch it was me he saw, because nobody else
ever rides Coaley. And by the Lord John, Al,
that&#8217;s the last time any man&#8217;s going to swear to
me in the dark by the horse I&#8217;m ridin&#8217;. The
Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit is going to have a lot more
saddle horses broke gentle than what they&#8217;ve got
now. And just between me and you, Al, any more
night-ridin&#8217; that&#8217;s done in this outfit ain&#8217;t going
to be done on cayuses that can be told a mile off
on a dark night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re durn tootin&#8217;, dad.&#8221; Al grinned while
he moistened the edge of his rolled cigarette. &#8220;I
thought at the time that Coaley was liable to
be a damn expensive horse for you to be ridin&#8217;.&#8221;
His eyes traveled over the restless herd, singling
out this horse and that for brief study. &#8220;There&#8217;s
some right speedy stuff in that bunch,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got the look of stayers, some of &#8217;em.
Take that there bay over there by the post: He&#8217;s
got a chest on him like a lion&ndash;&ndash;and look at them
legs! There&#8217;d be a good horse for you, dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One, maybe.&#8221; Tom spat into the dust and,
impelled by Al&#8217;s example, drew his own cigarette
papers from his shirt pocket. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; of
breakin&#8217; all we&#8217;ve got time for this summer.
Darn this here makin&#8217; one horse your trademark!&#8221;</p>
<p>Up at the house, Riley appeared in the kitchen
doorway and gave a long halloo while he wiped his
big freckled hand on his flour-sack apron. &#8220;Hoo-ee!
Come an&#8217; git it!&#8221; He waited a moment, until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
he saw riders dismounting and leading their
horses into the little corral. Then he turned back
to pour the coffee into the big, thick, white cups
standing in single file around the long oil-cloth-covered
table in the end of the kitchen nearest the
side door where the boys would presently come
trooping in to slide loose-jointedly into their
places on the long, shiny benches.</p>
<p>Tom pinched out the blaze of his match and
threw one long leg back over the corral fence.
His glance went to the riders beyond the big corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Lance at!&#8221; he called to Al, who was
riding around to the little corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can search me. He quit us when we got
the horses into the corral, and rode off up the Slide
trail. If I was to make a guess, I would say that
he went to meet Mary Hope. They been doing
that right frequent ever since she quit coming here.
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no skin off my nose&ndash;&ndash;but Lance, he&#8217;s
buildin&#8217; himself a mess uh trouble with old Scotty,
sure as you&#8217;re a foot high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn fool kid&ndash;&ndash;let the old folks git to scrappin&#8217;
amongst themselves, and the young ones start
the lovemakin&#8217;! I never knowed it to fail; but
you can skin me for a coyote if I know what makes
&#8217;em do it.&#8221; Grumbling to himself, Tom climbed
down and followed Al. &#8220;You can tell Riley I&#8217;ll
be late to dinner,&#8221; he said, when he had come up
to where Al was pulling the saddle off his horse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t much on buttin&#8217; into other folks&#8217; love
affairs, but I reckon it maybe might be a good idea
to throw a scare into them two. I&#8217;m plumb sick
of Scotch&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&#8217;t take it in a highball right
now if you was to shove one under my nose!&#8221;</p>
<p>Al laughed, looking over his shoulder at Tom
while he loosened the latigo. &#8220;If you can throw
a scare into Lance, you sure are a dinger,&#8221; he
bantered. &#8220;That youth is some heady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me like it runs in the family,&#8221; Tom
retorted. &#8220;You&#8217;re some heady yourself, if you
ever took notice. And I don&#8217;t give a damn how
heady any of you kids are; you can&#8217;t run any
rannies on your dad, and you want to put that
down in your little red book so you won&#8217;t forgit
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He led Coaley from the stable, mounted and rode
away up the Slide trail, more than half ashamed
of his errand. To interfere in a love affair went
against the grain, but to let a Lorrigan make love
to a Douglas on the heels of the trial was a pill so
bitter that he refused to swallow it.</p>
<p>He urged Coaley up the trail, his eyes somber
with resentment whenever he saw the fresh hoofprints
of Lance&#8217;s horse in the sandy places. Of
the three boys, Lance was his favorite, and it hurt
him to think that Lance had so little of the Lorrigan
pride that he would ride a foot out of his way
to speak to any one of the Douglas blood.</p>
<p>Up the Slide went Coaley, his head held proudly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
erect upon his high, arched neck, his feet choosing
daintily the little rough places in the rock where
long experience had taught him he would not slip.
Big as Tom was, Coaley carried him easily and
reached the top without so much as a flutter in the
flanks to show that the climb had cost him an effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dang darn shame I got to straddle
strange horses just because there ain&#8217;t another in
the country like you, Coaley,&#8221; he muttered, leaning
forward to smooth the silky hide under the
crinkly mane. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to set hard, now I&#8217;m
tellin&#8217; yuh, to throw my saddle on some plain, ordinary
cayuse. But it&#8217;s a bet I can&#8217;t afford to
overlook; they made that plain enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coaley pricked up his ears and looked, his big,
bright eyes taking in the shadow of a horse beside
a clump of wild currant bushes that grew in the
very base of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth. Tom grunted and
rode over that way, Coaley walking slowly, his
knees bending springily like a dancer feeling out
his muscles.</p>
<p>Lance stood with his back toward them. His hat
was pushed far back on his head, and he was looking
at Mary Hope, who leaned against the rock
and stared down into the valley below. Her hair,
Tom observed, was not &#8220;slicked back&#8221; to-day.
It had been curled a little, probably on rags twisted
in after she had gone to bed and taken out before
she arose in the morning, lest her mother discover
her frivolity and lecture her long,&ndash;&ndash;and, worse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
still, make her wet a comb and take all of the curl
out. A loose strand blew across her tanned cheek,
so that she reached up absently and tucked it behind
her ear, where it would not stay for longer
than a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I didna know you would be here,&#8221;
she said, without taking her eyes off the valley.
&#8220;It is a view I like better than most, and I have a
right to ride where I please. And I have no wish
to ride out of my way to be friends with any one
that tried to make my father out a liar and an
unjust man. He may be hard, but he is honest.
And that is more than some&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than some can say&ndash;&ndash;us Lorrigans, for
instance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didna say that, but if the coat fits, you can
put it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope bit her lip and lashed a weed with
her quirt. &#8220;All of this is none of my doing,&#8221; she
added, with a dullness in her voice that may have
meant either regret or resentment. &#8220;You hate
my father, and you are mad because I canna side
with you and hate him too. I am sorry the trouble
came up, but I canna see how you expect me to go
on coming to see your mither when you know my
father would never permit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that like you were speaking a piece.
How long did you lay awake last night, making
it up? You can&#8217;t make me swallow that, anyway.
Your father never permitted you to come in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
first place, and you know it. You made believe
that old skate ran away with you down the trail,
and that you couldn&#8217;t stop him. You&#8217;ve been coming
over to our place ever since, and you never
asked old Scotty whether he would permit it or not.
I&#8217;m not saying anything about myself, but it hurts
Belle to have you throw her down right now.
Under the circumstances it makes her feel as if you
thought we were thieves and stole your dad&#8217;s yearling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re not, but you sure are acting it.
If you don&#8217;t think that, why don&#8217;t you go on taking
music lessons from Belle? What made you
stop, all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Mary Hope stiffly, &#8220;is my own
affair, Lance Lorrigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mine, let me tell you. It&#8217;s mine, because
it hits Belle; and what hits her hits me. If you
think she isn&#8217;t good enough for you to visit, why
in thunder have you been coming all this while?
She isn&#8217;t any worse than she was two months ago,
is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re acting it, and that&#8217;s a darn sight
worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to know that with all this trouble
between your father and my father&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, can you tell me when they ever did have
any truck together? Your father doesn&#8217;t hate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
our outfit a darn bit worse than he ever did. He
found a chance to knife us, that&#8217;s all. It isn&#8217;t that
he never wanted to before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll thank you, Lance Lorrigan, not to accuse
my father of knifing anybody. He&#8217;s my father
and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that isn&#8217;t anything to brag about, if you
ask me. I&#8217;d rather have my father doing time for
stealing, than have him a darned, hide-bound old
hypocrite that will lie a man into the pen, and then
go around and pull a long face and call himself a
Christian!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father doesna lie! And he is not a hypocrite
either. If your father was half as&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She
stopped abruptly, her face going red when she saw
Tom sitting on his horse beyond the shoulder of
rock, regarding her with that inscrutable smile
which never had failed to make her squirm mentally
and wonder what he thought of her. She
stood up, trembling a little.</p>
<p>Lance turned slowly and met Tom&#8217;s eyes without
flinching. &#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said, on guard against
the two of them, wondering what had brought his
dad to this particular point at this particular time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello. How d&#8217;yuh do, Miss Douglas? Lance,
dinner&#8217;s getting cold waiting for you.&#8221; Tom
lifted his hat to Mary Hope, turned, and rode back
whence he had come, never glancing over his
shoulder but nevertheless keenly alert for the
sound of voices.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>He was not quite through the Slide when he
heard the hoof beats of Lance&#8217;s horse come clicking
down over the rocks. Tom smiled to himself
as he rode on, never looking back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINE</h2>
<h3>A LITTLE SCOTCH</h3>
</div>
<p>In the Black Rim country March is a month of
raw winds and cold rains, with sleet and snow
and storm clouds tumbling high in the West and
spreading to the East, where they hang lowering
at the earth and then return to empty their burden
of moisture upon the shrinking live things below.</p>
<p>In the thinly settled places March is also the
time when children go shivering to school, harried
by weather that has lost a little of its deadliness.
In January and February their lives would not be
safe from sudden blizzards, but by the middle of
March they may venture forth upon the quest of
learning.</p>
<p>Black Rim country was at best but scantily supplied
with schools, and on the Devil&#8217;s Tooth range
seven young Americans&ndash;&ndash;three of them adopted
from Sweden&ndash;&ndash;were in danger of growing up in
deplorable ignorance of what learning lies hidden
in books. A twelve-mile stretch of country had
neither schoolhouse, teacher nor school officers
empowered to establish a school. Until the Swedish
family moved into a shack on the AJ ranch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
there had not been children enough to make a
teacher worth while. But the Swedish family
thirsted for knowledge of the English language,
and their lamenting awoke the father of four
purely range-bred products to a sense of duty
toward his offspring.</p>
<p>Wherefore Mary Hope Douglas, home from two
winters in Pocatello, where she had lived with a
cousin twice removed and had gone to school and
had learned much, was one day invited to teach a
school in the Devil&#8217;s Tooth neighborhood.</p>
<p>True, there was no schoolhouse, but there was a
deserted old shack on the road to Jumpoff. A
few benches and a stove and table would transform
it into a seat of learning, and there were an old
shed and corral where the pupils might keep their
saddle horses during school hours. She would be
paid five dollars a month per head, Jim Boyle of
the AJ further explained. Seven &#8220;heads&#8221; at five
dollars each would amount to thirty-five dollars
a month, and Mary Hope felt her heart jump at
the prospect of earning so much money of her own.
Moreover, to teach school had long been her secret
ambition, the solid foundation of many an air
castle. She forthwith consented to become the
very first school-teacher in the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
neighborhood, which hoped some day to become a
real school district.</p>
<p>She would have to ride five miles every morning
and evening, and her morning ride would carry her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
five miles nearer the Lorrigan ranch, two of them
along their direct trail to Jumpoff. Mary Hope
would never admit to herself that this small detail
interested her, but she thought of it the moment
Jim Boyle suggested the old Whipple shack
as a schoolhouse.</p>
<p>Tom Lorrigan, riding home from Jumpoff after
two days spent in Lava, pulled his horse down to
a walk and then stopped him in the trail while he
stared hard at the Whipple shack. Five horses
walked uneasily around inside the corral, manes
and tails whipping in the gale that blew cold from
out the north. From the bent stovepipe of the
shack a wisp of smoke was caught and bandied
here and there above the pole-and-dirt roof. It
seemed incredible to Tom that squatters could have
come in and taken possession of the place in his
short absence, but there was no other explanation
that seemed at all reasonable.</p>
<p>Squatters were not welcome on the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
range. Tom rode up to the shack, dismounted and
let Coaley&#8217;s reins drop to the ground. He hesitated
a minute before the door, in doubt as to the
necessity for knocking. Then his knuckles struck
the loose panel twice, and he heard the sound of
footsteps. Tom pulled his hat down tighter on his
forehead and waited.</p>
<p>When Mary Hope Douglas pulled open the door,
astonishment held them both dumb. He had not
seen the girl for more than a year,&ndash;&ndash;he was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
certain at first that it was she. But there was no
mistaking those eyes of hers, Scotch blue and uncompromisingly
direct in their gaze. Tom pulled
loose and lifted the hat that he had just tightened,
and as she backed from the doorway he entered the
shack without quite knowing why he should do so.
Comprehensively he surveyed the mean little room,
bare of everything save three benches with crude
shelves before them, a kitchen table and a yellow-painted
chair with two-thirds of the paint worn off
under the incessant scrubbing of mother Douglas.
The three Swedes, their rusty overcoats buttoned
to their necks, goggled at him round-eyed over the
tops of their new spelling books, then ducked and
grinned at one another. The four Boyle children,
also bundled in wraps, exchanged sidelong glances
and pulled themselves up alert and expectant in
their seats.</p>
<p>&#8220;School, eh?&#8221; Tom observed, turning as Mary
Hope pushed the door shut against the wind that
rattled the small shack and came toward him shivering
and pulling her sweater collar closer about
her neck. &#8220;When did this happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started teaching here, Mr. Lorrigan.&#8221;
Then, mindful of her manners, she tempered the
pertness with a smile. &#8220;And that was yesterday.
Will you sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks&ndash;&ndash;I just stopped to see who was
livin&#8217; here, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He broke off to look up at
the dirt roof. A clod the size of his fist had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
loosened by the shaking of the wind, and plumped
down in the middle of the teacher&#8217;s desk. With
the edge of his palm he swept clod and surrounding
small particles of dirt into his hat crown, and
carried them to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an empty calf shed over at the ranch
that would make a better schoolhouse than this,&#8221;
he observed. &#8220;It&#8217;s got a shingle roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope was picking small lumps of dirt out
of her hair, which she wore in a pompadour that
disclosed a very nice forehead. &#8220;I just love a roof
with shingles on it,&#8221; she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m.&#8221; Tom looked up at the sagging poles
with the caked mud showing in the cracks between
where the poles had shrunken and warped under
the weight. A fresh gust of wind rattled dust into
his eyes, and the oldest Swede chortled an abrupt
&#8220;Ka-hugh!&#8221; that set the other six tittering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence! <i>Shame</i> on you!&#8221; Mary Hope reproved
them sternly, rapping on the kitchen table
with a foot rule of some soft wood that blazoned
along its length the name of a Pocatello hardware
store. &#8220;Get to work this instant or I shall be
compelled to keep you all in at recess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You better haze &#8217;em all home at recess, and get
where it&#8217;s warm before you catch your death of
cold,&#8221; Tom advised, giving first aid to his eye with
a corner of his white-dotted blue handkerchief.
&#8220;This ain&#8217;t fit for cattle, such a day as this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A north wind like this would blow through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
anything,&#8221; Mary Hope loyally defended the shack.
&#8220;It was quite comfortable yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t send a dog here to school,&#8221; said
Tom. &#8220;Can&#8217;t they dig up any better place than
this for you to teach in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The parents of these children are paying out
of their own pockets to have them taught, as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be paying out of their own pockets to
have them planted, if they ain&#8217;t careful,&#8221; Tom
predicted dryly. &#8220;How&#8217;re you fixed for firewood?
Got enough to keep warm on a hot day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope smiled faintly. &#8220;Mr. Boyle hauled
us a load of sage brush, and the boys chop wood
mornings and noons&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s a punishment when
they don&#8217;t behave, or if they miss their lessons.
But&ndash;&ndash;the stove doesn&#8217;t seem to draw very well,
in this wind. It smokes more than it throws out
heat.&#8221; She added hastily, &#8220;It drew all right yesterday.
It&#8217;s this wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you going to do if this wind keeps up?
It&#8217;s liable to blow for a week or two, this time of
year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll manage to get along all right.
They&#8217;d probably be out playing in it anyway, if
they weren&#8217;t in school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. And what about you?&#8221; Tom looked at
her, blinking rapidly with his left eye that was
growing bloodshot and watery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Why, I&#8217;ve lived here all my life, and I
ought to be used to a little bad weather.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hunh.&#8221; Tom shivered in the draught. &#8220;So
have I lived here all my life; but I&#8217;ll be darned if
I would want to sit in this shack all day, the way
the wind whistles through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might do it, though&ndash;&ndash;if it was your only
way of earning money,&#8221; Mary Hope suggested
shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I might,&#8221; Tom admitted, &#8220;but I sure
would stop up a few cracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve hardly got settled yet,&#8221; said Mary Hope.
&#8220;I intend to stuff the cracks with rags just as
soon as possible. Is your eye still paining? That
dirt is miserable stuff to stick in a person&#8217;s eye.
Shall I try and get it out? Yesterday I got some
in mine, and I had an awful time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dismissed the children primly, with a self-conscious
dignity and some chagrin at their boorish
clatter, their absolute ignorance of discipline.
&#8220;I shall ring the bell in ten minutes,&#8221; she told them
while they scuffled to the door. &#8220;I shall give you
two minutes after the bell rings to get into your
seats and be prepared for duty. Every minute
after that must be made up after school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay skoll go home now, sen you skoll not keep
me by school from tan minootes,&#8221; the oldest of
the Swedes stopped long enough to bellow at her
from the doorway. &#8220;Ole og Helge skoll go med.
Ve got long way from school, og ve don&#8217;t be by
dark ven ve come by home!&#8221;</p>
<p>He seized the square tobacco boxes, originally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
made to hold a pound of &#8220;plug cut,&#8221; and afterwards
dedicated to whatever use a ranch man
might choose to put them. Where schools flourished,
the tobacco boxes were used for lunch.
The Swedes carried three tied in flour sacks and
fastened to the saddles. The wind carried them at
a run to the corral. The two smaller boys, Ole
and Helge, rode, one behind the other, on one horse,
a flea-bitten gray with an enlarged knee and a
habit of traveling with its neck craned to the left.
Christian, the leader of the revolt, considered himself
well-mounted on a pot-bellied bay that could
still be used to round up cattle, if the drive was
not more than a couple of miles. Looking after
them from the window that faced the corral, Tom
could not wonder that they were anxious to start
early.</p>
<p>&#8220;You better let the rest go, too,&#8221; he advised the
perturbed teacher, looking out at the four Boyle
children huddled in the shelter of the shack, the
skirts of the girl whipping in the wind like a pillowslip
on a clothesline in a gale. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t any
sense trying to teach school in a place like this,
in such weather. Don&#8217;t you know them kids have
got all of twelve miles to ride, facing this wind
most of the way? And you&#8217;ve got to ride five
miles; and when the sun drops it&#8217;s going to be raw
enough to put icicles on your ribs under the skin.
Tell &#8217;em to go home. Pore little devils, I wouldn&#8217;t
ask a cow-critter to face this wind after sundown.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You do not understand that I must have discipline
in this school, Mr. Lorrigan. To-morrow I
shall have to punish those Swedes for leaving
school without permission. I shall make an example
of Christian, for his impudence. I do not
think he will want to disobey me again, very
soon!&#8221; Mary Hope took her handkerchief from
her pocket, refusing to consider for one moment
the significance of its flapping in the wind while
the windows and doors were closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just plain stubborn,&#8221; Tom said bluntly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve no business hanging out in a place like
this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve the business of teaching school, Mr. Lorrigan.
I suppose that is as important to me as your
business is to you. And I can&#8217;t permit my pupils
to rebel against my authority. You would not let
your men dictate to you, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They would have a right to call for their time
if I asked them to do some damfool thing like sitting
in this shack with the wind blowing through
it at forty miles an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Mr. Lorrigan, that I must remind
you that gentlemen do not indulge in profanity
before a lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hell! What have I said that was outa the
way? I wasn&#8217;t cussing; I was telling you what
your father and mother ought to tell you, and what
they would if they didn&#8217;t think more of a few dollars
than they do of their kid&#8217;s health. But I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
reckon it&#8217;s my put-in; only it&#8217;s any man&#8217;s business
to see that women and kids don&#8217;t freeze to death.
And by the humpin&#8217; hyenas&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>With her lips in a straight line, her eyes very
hard and bright and with a consciousness of heaping
coals of fire on the head of an enemy of her
house, Mary Hope had twisted a corner of her
handkerchief into a point, moistened it by the
simple and primitive method of placing the point
between her lips, and was preparing to remove the
dirt from Tom&#8217;s watering eye, the ball of which
was a deep pink from irritation. But Tom swung
abruptly away from her, went stilting on his high
heels to the door, pulled it open with a yank and
rounded the corner where the four Boyle children
stood leaning against the house, their chilled fingers
clasped together so that two hands made one
fist, their teeth chattering while they discussed
the Swedes and tried to mimic Christian&#8217;s very
Swedish accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Og</i> is <i>and</i>,&#8221; said Minnie Boyle. &#8220;And <i>skoll</i>
is <i>shall</i>. Swede&#8217;s easy. And <i>med</i> means <i>with</i>&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, it&#8217;s just the way they try to say it in English,&#8221;
Fred Boyle contradicted. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t Swede&ndash;&ndash;but
gee, when the Scotch and the Swede goes
in the air to-morrow, I bet there&#8217;ll be fun. If
Mary Hope tries to lick Chris&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You kids straddle your cayuses and hit for
home,&#8221; Tom interrupted them. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t going
to be any more school to-day. Them your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
horses in the shed? Well, you hump along and
saddle up and beat it. Go!&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not speak threateningly, at least he did
not speak angrily. But the four Boyle children
gave him one affrighted glance and started on a
run for the corral, looking back over their shoulders
now and then as if they expected a spatter of
bullets to follow them.</p>
<p>At the corral gate Minnie Boyle stopped and
turned as though she meant to retrace her steps to
the house, but Tom waved her back. So Minnie
went home weeping over the loss of a real dinner-bucket
and a slate sponge which she was afraid
the Swedes might steal from her if they came earlier
to school than she.</p>
<p>When Tom turned to re&euml;nter the shack for a
final word with Mary Hope, and to let her give
first aid to his eye if she would, he found that small
person standing just behind him with set lips and
clenched fists and her hair blowing loose from its
hairpins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Tom Lorrigan, you can just call those
children back!&#8221; she cried, her lips bluing in the
cold gale that beat upon her. &#8220;Do you think that
with all your lawlessness you can come and break
up my school? You have bullied my father&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do worse than bully him, if I had him in
handy reach right now,&#8221; Tom drawled, and took
her by the shoulder and pushed her inside. &#8220;Any
man that will let a woman sit all day in a place like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
this&ndash;&ndash;and I don&#8217;t care a damn if you are earning
money doing it!&ndash;&ndash;oughta have his neck wrung.
I&#8217;m going to saddle your horse for yuh while you
bundle up. And then you&#8217;re going home, if I have
to herd yuh like I would a white heifer. I always
have heard of Scotch stubbornness&ndash;&ndash;but there&#8217;s
something beats that all to thunder. Git yore
things on. Yore horse will be ready in about five
minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bettered his estimate, returning in just four
minutes to find the door locked against him.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you <i>dare</i> come in here!&#8221; Mary Hope called
out, her voice shrill with excitement. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll
<i>brain</i> you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you will, will yuh?&#8221; Whereupon Tom
heaved himself against the door and lurched in
with the lock dangling.</p>
<p>Mary Hope had a stick of wood in her two hands,
but she had not that other essential to quick combat,
the courage to swing the club on the instant
of her enemy&#8217;s appearance. She hesitated,
backed and threatened him futilely.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&ndash;&ndash;fine! Scotch stubbornness&ndash;&ndash;and
not a damn thing to back it up! Where&#8217;s your
coat? Here. Git into it.&#8221; Without any prelude,
any apology, he wrested the stick of wood
from her, pulled her coat off a nail near by, and
held it outspread, the armholes convenient to her
hands. With her chin shivering, Mary Hope
obeyed the brute strength of the man. She dug
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
her teeth into her lip and thrust her arms spitefully
into the coat sleeves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s yo&#8217;re hat. Better tie it on, if yuh got
anything to tie it with. Here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He twitched his big silk neckerchief from his
neck, pulled her toward him with a gentle sort of
brutality, and tied the neckerchief over her hat and
under her chin. He did it exactly as though he
was handling a calf that he did not wish to frighten
or hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got any mittens? Gloves? Put &#8217;em on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Standing back in the corner behind the door,
facing Tom&#8217;s bigness and his inexorable strength,
Mary Hope put on her Indian tanned, beaded buckskin
gloves that were in the pockets of her coat.
Tom waited until she had tucked the coatsleeves
inside the gauntlets. He took her by the arm and
pulled her to the door, pushed her through it and
held her with one hand, gripping her arm while
he fastened the door by the simple method of pulling
it shut so hard that it jammed in the casing.
He led her to where her horse stood backed to the
wind and tail whipping between his legs, and his
eyes blinking half shut against the swirls of dust
dug out of the dry sod of the grassland. Without
any spoken command, Tom took the reins and
flipped them up over Rab&#8217;s neck, standing forward
and close to the horse&#8217;s shoulder. Mary Hope
knew that she must mount or be lifted bodily into
the saddle. She mounted, tears of wrath spilling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
from her eyes and making her cheeks cold where
they trickled down.</p>
<p>The Boyle children, kicking and quirting their
two horses&ndash;&ndash;riding double, in the Black Rim
country, was considered quite comfortable enough
for children&ndash;&ndash;were already on their way home.
Mary Hope looked at their hurried retreat and
turned furiously, meaning to overtake them and
order them back. Tom Lorrigan, she reminded
herself, might force her to leave the schoolhouse,
but he would scarcely dare to carry his abuse
farther.</p>
<p>She had gone perhaps ten rods when came a
pounding of hoofs, and Coaley&#8217;s head and proudly
arched neck heaved alongside poor, draggle-maned
old Rab.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re headed wrong. Have I got to haze yuh
all the way home? Might as well. I want to tell
yore dad a few things.&#8221;</p>
<p>He twitched the reins, and Coaley obediently
shouldered Rab out of the trail and turned him
neatly toward the Douglas ranch. Even Rab was
Scotch, it would seem. He laid his ears flat, swung
his head unexpectedly, and bared his teeth at
Coaley. But Coaley was of the Lorrigans. He
did not bare his teeth and threaten; he reached out
like a rattler and nipped Rab&#8217;s neck so neatly
that a spot the size of a quarter showed pink where
the hair had been. Rab squealed, whirled and
kicked, but Coaley was not there at that particular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
moment. He came back with the battle light in his
eyes, and Rab clattered away in a stiff-legged run.
After him went Coaley, loping easily, with high,
rabbit jumps that told how he would love to show
the speed that was in him, if only Tom would
loosen the reins a half inch.</p>
<p>For a mile Tom kept close to Rab&#8217;s heels.
Then, swinging up alongside, he turned to Mary
Hope, that baffling half smile on his lips and the
look in his eyes that had never failed to fill her
with trepidation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t blaming yuh for being Scotch and stubborn,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but you notice there&#8217;s something
beats it four ways from the jack. Yo go on home,
now, and don&#8217;t yuh go back to that board cullender
till the weather warms up. And tell yore folks
that Tom Lorrigan broke up yore school for yuh,
so they wouldn&#8217;t have to break up a case of pneumonia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope was framing a sentence of defiance
when Coaley wheeled and went back the way they
had come, so swiftly that even with shouting she
could not have made herself heard in that whooping
wind. She pulled Rab to a willing stand and
stared after Tom, hating him with her whole heart.
Hating him for his domination of her from the
moment he entered the schoolhouse where he had
no business at all to be; hating him because even
his bullying had been oddly gentle; hating him
most of all because he was so like Lance&ndash;&ndash;and because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
he was not Lance, who was away out in California,
going to college, and had never written
her one line in all the time he had been gone.</p>
<p>Had it been Lance who rode up to the schoolhouse
door, she would have known how to meet and
master the situation. She would not have been
afraid of Lance, she told herself savagely. She
wouldn&#8217;t have been afraid of Tom&ndash;&ndash;but the
whole Black Rim was afraid of Tom. Well, just
wait until she happened some day to meet Lance!
At least she would make him pay! For two years
of silence and brooding over his hardihood for
taking her to task for her unfriendliness, and for
this new and unbearable outrage, she would make
Lance Lorrigan pay, if the fates ever let them
meet again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TEN</h2>
<h3>THE LORRIGAN WAY</h3>
</div>
<p>The Lorrigan family was dining comfortably
in the light of a huge lamp with a rose-tinted
shade decorated with an extremely sinuous wreath
of morning glories trailing around the lower rim.
A clatter of pots and pans told that Riley was
washing his &#8220;cookin&#8217; dishes&#8221; in the lean-to kitchen
that had been added to the house as an afterthought,
the fall before. Belle had finished her
dessert of hot mince pie, and leaned back now with
a freshly lighted cigarette poised in her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you got up your sleeve, Tom?&#8221; she
asked abruptly, handing Duke her silver matchbox
in response to a gestured request for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My arm,&#8221; Tom responded promptly, pushing
back his wristband to give her the proof.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, cut out the comedy, Tom. You&#8217;ve been
doing something that you&#8217;re holding out on us.
I know that look in your eye; I ought, having you
and Lance to watch. You&#8217;re near enough to
double in a lead and not even the manager know
which is who. You&#8217;ve been doing something, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
Lance knows what it is. Now, I&#8217;ll get it outa you
two if I have to shoot it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance, just returned from Berkeley during Easter
holidays, lifted one eyebrow at Tom, lowered
one lid very slowly, and gave his mother a level,
sidelong glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your husband, my dear madame, has been engaged
in a melodramatic role created by himself.
He is painfully undecided whether the hisses of
the orchestra attest his success as a villian;
whether the whistling up in the gallery demands an
encore, or heralds an offering of cabbages and
ripe poultry fruit. I myself did not witness the
production, but I did chance to meet the star just
as he was leaving the stage. To me he confided
the fact that he does not know whether it was a
one-act farce he put on, or a five-act tragedy
played accidentally hind-side before, with the villian-still-pursuing-her
act set first instead of
fourth. I am but slightly versed in the drama
as played in the Black Rim the past two years.
Perhaps if the star would repeat his lines&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For-the-Lord-sake, Lance! As a dramatic
critic you&#8217;re the punkest proposition I ever
slammed my door against. Talk the way you were
brought up to talk and tell me the truth. What
did Tom do, and how did he do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance drew his black eyebrows together, studying
carefully the ethics of the case. &#8220;Belle, you
must remember that Dad is my father. Dad must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
remember that you are my mother&ndash;&ndash;technically
speaking. By heck, if it wasn&#8217;t for remembering
how you used to chase me up on the barn every
day or so with your quirt, I&#8217;d swear that you grew
up with me and are at this present moment at least
two years younger than I am. However, they <i>say</i>
you are my mother. And&ndash;&ndash;do you want to know,
honestly, what dad has been doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>going</i> to know,&#8221; Belle informed him
trenchantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me tell you. I&#8217;ll break it gently.
Tom, your husband, the self-confessed father of
your offspring, to-day rode to an alleged schoolhouse,
threatened, ordered, and by other felonious
devices hazed three Swedes and the four Boyle
kids out of the place and toward their several
homes and then when the schoolmarm very discreetly
locked the door and mildly informed him
that she would brain him with a twig off a sage-bush
if he burst the lock, he straightway forgot
that he was old enough to have a son quite old
enough to frighten, abduct and otherwise lighten
the monotonous life of said schoolmarm, and became
a bold, bad man. He bursted that door off
its hinges&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar. I busted the lock,&#8221; Tom
grunted, without removing the cigarette from his
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;He busted the lock of that door, madame;
rushed in, wrested the sprig of sage&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was a club the size of my arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrested the club from that schoolmarm, brutally
and ferociously forced her into her coat and
hat, compelled her to mount her horse, and then
deliberately drove her away from that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Lance. You remind me of one of
those monstrosities they serve in the Lava House,
that they call a combination salad. It&#8217;s about two-thirds
wilted lettuce and the rest beets and carrots.
I don&#8217;t ever eat them, but if I did they&#8217;d
taste just like you sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right, then. With only two weeks&#8217;
vacation I won&#8217;t have time for a real spree of
Black Rim dialect and sober up in time for the
University. Let me mix it, Belle. I&#8217;ll eat my
own verbal combination salad, if anybody has to.
I won&#8217;t ask you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll eat &#8217;em, all right,&#8221; Tom stated briefly,
lifting an eyebrow at him. &#8220;All I done, Belle, was
to ride up to the Whipple shack to see who was
camped there. It was that Douglas girl and the
Boyle kids and them Swedes that live over beyond
Boyle&#8217;s. They was all setting there having school,&ndash;&ndash;with
their overcoats on, half froze, and the wind
howling through like it was a corral fence. So
when the Douglas girl got her Scotch up and said
she wouldn&#8217;t turn &#8217;em loose to go home, I turned
&#8217;em loose myself and told &#8217;em to beat it. And
then I hazed her home. Seems like they think that
shack is good enough for women and kids; but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
wouldn&#8217;t keep pigs in it, myself, without doing a
lot of fixing on it first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What dad seems to overlook is the attitude
Boyle and old Scotty will take, when they hear
how Tom Lorrigan broke up school for &#8217;em.
There&#8217;ll be something drop, if you ask me&ndash;&ndash;I
hope it drops before I have to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle looked at him meditatively. &#8220;And where
were you, Lance? With Mary Hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer, Lance smiled, with his mouth
twisted a little to one side, which made him resemble
Tom more than ever. &#8220;A fellow sure does
hate to have his own father cut in&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what ails you! Well, you may just
as well know first as last that Mary Hope hasn&#8217;t
spoken to one of us since the time they had Tom
up in court for stealing that yearling. You
know how they acted; and if you&#8217;d come home
last summer instead of fooling around in California,
you&#8217;d know they haven&#8217;t changed a darn
bit. It&#8217;s a shame. I used to like Mary Hope.
She always seemed kinda lonesome and half
scared&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got over it, then,&#8221; Tom interrupted,
chuckling. &#8220;She&#8217;s got spunk enough now for two
of her size. Had that club lifted, ready to brain
me when I went in, just because I&#8217;d spoiled her
rules for her. If she had as much sense as she&#8217;s
got nerve&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they build her a schoolhouse, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
they want her to teach?&#8221; Belle pushed back her
chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever know the AJ to spend a cent they didn&#8217;t
have to?&#8221; Duke asked. &#8220;Or old Scotty? The
Swede ain&#8217;t able. How&#8217;re they paying her? This
ain&#8217;t any school district.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much a head,&#8221; Tom answered. &#8220;Not
much, I reckon. The girl&#8217;s got nerve. I&#8217;ll say
that much for her. She was dodgin&#8217; clods of dirt
from the roof, and shivering and teaching to beat
hell when I got there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to be awful sore at you, Tom,
for this,&#8221; Belle predicted. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to say
you did it because you hate the Douglases, and it
was Mary Hope teaching. Jim Boyle will side
with old Scotty, and there&#8217;ll be the devil and all to
pay. Did you tell those kids why you sent &#8217;em
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told the girl. No, I never told the kids. The
Swedes had sense enough to beat it when she let
&#8217;em out for recess. She got fighty over that, and
wouldn&#8217;t let the school out and wait for good
weather, so I went out and told the Boyle kids to hit
for home. Humpin&#8217; cats, <i>somebody</i> had to do
something!</p>
<p>&#8220;So then the Scotch come out strong in the girl,
and I made her go home too. If I see &#8217;em in that
shack to-morrow, and the weather like it is and
like it&#8217;s going to be, I&#8217;ll send &#8217;em home again.
What in thunder do I care what old Scotty and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
Jim Boyle says about it? If they want a woman
to learn their kids to read, they&#8217;d oughta give her
a better place than the Whipple shack to keep
school in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Belle. &#8220;A roof and four
walls is all you can expect of them. It&#8217;s a shame.
I expect Mary Hope is tickled to death to be earning
the money, too. She was taking music all winter
in Pocatello, I heard, and she and her mother
saved up the money in nickels&ndash;&ndash;Lord knows how,
the way old Scotty watches them!&ndash;&ndash;to pay for the
lessons. It&#8217;s a shame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they do for water? Old Man Whipple
always hauled it in barrels when he tried
to hold down the camp.&#8221; Al, tilting back his
chair, placidly picking his teeth, spoke for the first
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see no water barrel,&#8221; Tom answered.
&#8220;I reckon they make dry camp. They had a stove
that smoked, and three benches with some kinda
shelf for their books, and the girl was using a
strip of tar-paper for a blackboard. But there
was no water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what sort of country is this Black Rim,
anyway?&#8221; Lance studied the end of his cigarette,
lifting his left eyebrow just as his father had
done five minutes before. &#8220;I hope to heck I
haven&#8217;t come home to remodel the morals of the
country, or to strut around and play college-young-man
like a boob; but on the square, folks, it looks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
to me as though the Rim needs a lesson in citizenship.
It doesn&#8217;t mean anything in our lives,
whether there is a schoolhouse in the country or
not. Belle has looked out for us boys, in the matter
of learning the rudiments and a good deal
besides. Say, Belle, do you know they took my
voice and fitted a glee club to it? I was the glee.
And a real, live professor told me I had technique.
I told him I must have caught it changing climates&ndash;&ndash;but
however, what you couldn&#8217;t give us with the
books, you handed us with the quirt&ndash;&ndash;and here
and now I want to say I appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I appreciate your appreciation, and
I wish to heaven you wouldn&#8217;t ramble all over the
range when you start to say a thing. That&#8217;s one
thing you learned in school that I&#8217;d like to take
outa you with a quirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was merely pointing out how we, ourselves,
personally, do not need a schoolhouse. But I was
also saying that the Rim ought to have a lesson in
real citizenship. They call the Lorrigans bad.
All right; that&#8217;s a fine running start. I&#8217;d say,
let&#8217;s give &#8217;em a jolt. I&#8217;m game to donate a couple
of steers toward a schoolhouse&ndash;&ndash;a <i>regular</i> schoolhouse,
with the Stars and Stripes on the front end,
and a bench behind the door for the water bucket,
and a blackboard up in front, and a woodshed behind&ndash;&ndash;with
a door into it so the schoolmarm
needn&#8217;t put on her overshoes and mittens every
time she tells one of the Swedes to put a stick of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
wood in the stove. I&#8217;d like to do that, and not say
a darn word until it&#8217;s ready to move into. And
then I&#8217;d like to stick my hands in my pockets and
watch what the Rim would do about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wondered quite a lot, in the last two years,
whether it&#8217;s the Black Rim or the Lorrigan outfit
that&#8217;s all wrong. I know all about grandad and
all the various and sundry uncles and forbears that
earned us the name of being bad; it makes darn
interesting stuff to tell now and then to some of
the fellows who were raised in a prune orchard
and will sit and listen with watering mouths and
eyes goggling. I&#8217;ve been a hero, months on end,
just for the things that my grandad did in the
seventies. Of course,&#8221; he pulled his lips into their
whimsical smile, &#8220;I&#8217;ve touched up the family biography
here and there and made heroes of us all.
But the fact remains there are degrees and differences
in badness. I&#8217;ve a notion that the Black
Rim, taken by and large, is a damn sight worse
than the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit. I&#8217;d like to try the
experiment of making the AJ and old Scotty
ashamed of themselves. I&#8217;d like to try a schoolhouse
on &#8217;em, and see if they&#8217;re human enough
to appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duke, turning his head slowly, glanced at Al,
and from him to Tom. Without moving a muscle
of their faces the two returned his look. Al slid
his cigarette stub thoughtfully into his coffee cup
and let his breath out carefully in a long sigh that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
was scarcely audible. Tom took a corner of his
lower lip between his teeth, matching Lance, who
had the same trick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honey, that&#8217;s fine of you! There aren&#8217;t many
that realize what a lot of satisfaction there is in
doing something big and generous and making the
other fellow ashamed of himself. And it would
be a God&#8217;s mercy to Mary Hope, poor child.
Leave it to the AJ and whatever other outfit there
is to send pupils, and Mary Hope could teach in
the Whipple shack till it rattled down on top of
them. I know what the place is. I put up there
once in a hailstorm. It isn&#8217;t fit for cattle, as Tom
says, unless they&#8217;ve fixed it a lot. I&#8217;ll donate the
furniture; I&#8217;ll make out the order right this evening
for seats and blackboard and a globe and
everything, and make it a rush order!&#8221; Belle
pushed back her chair and came around to Lance,
slipped her arms around his neck and tousled his
wavy mop of hair with her chin. &#8220;If the rest
won&#8217;t come through you and I&#8217;ll do it, honey&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who said we wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221; Tom got up,
stretching his arms high above his head,&ndash;&ndash;which
was very bad manners, but showed how supple he
still was, and how well-muscled. &#8220;No one ever
called me a piker&ndash;&ndash;and let me hear about it.
Sure, we&#8217;ll build a schoolhouse for &#8217;em, seeing
they&#8217;re too cussed stingy to build one themselves.
There&#8217;s the lumber I had hauled out for a new
chicken house; to-morrow I&#8217;ll have it hauled up to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
some good building spot, and we&#8217;ll have it done before
the AJ wakes up to the fact that anything&#8217;s
going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll chip in enough to make her big enough for
dances,&#8221; volunteered Duke. &#8220;Darn this riding
fifteen or twenty miles to a dance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll paint &#8217;er, if you let me pick out the color,&#8221;
said Al. &#8220;Where are you going to set &#8217;er?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with doing the thing in
style, and giving a house-warming dance, and
turning it over to the neighborhood with a
speech?&#8221; bantered Lance, as they adjourned to
the big living room, taking the idea with them and
letting it grow swiftly in enthusiasm. &#8220;That
would celebrate my visit, and I&#8217;d get a chance to
size up the Rim folks and see how they react to
kindness. Lordy, folks, let&#8217;s do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might,&#8221; Belle considered the suggestion,
while she thumbed the latest mail-order catalogue,
the size of a family bible and much more assiduously
studied. &#8220;They&#8217;d come, all right!&#8221; she
added, with a scornful laugh. &#8220;Even old Scotty
would come, if he thought it wouldn&#8217;t cost him anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, by heck, we won&#8217;t <i>let</i> it cost him anything!&#8221;
Lance stood leaning against the wall
by the stove, his arms folded, the fingers of his left
hand tapping his right forearm. He did not know
that this was a Lorrigan habit, born of an old necessity
of having the right hand convenient to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
revolver butt, and matched by the habit of carrying
a six-shooter hooked inside the trousers band
on the left side.</p>
<p>Tom, studying Lance, thought how much he
resembled his grandfather on the night Buck Sanderson
was killed in a saloon in Salmon City. Old
Tom had leaned against the wall at the end of the
bar, with his arms folded and his fingers tapping
his right forearm, just as Lance was doing now.
He had lifted one eyebrow and pulled a corner of
his lip between his teeth when Buck came blustering
in. Just as Lance smiled at Duke&#8217;s chaffing,
Tom&#8217;s father had smiled when Buck came swaggering
up to him with bold eyes full of fight and his
right thumb hooked in his chap belt. Old Tom had
not moved; he had remained leaning negligently
against the wall with his arms folded. But the
strike of a snake was not so quick as the drop of
his hand to his gun.</p>
<p>Tom was not much given to reminiscence; but
to-night, seeing Lance with two years of man-growth
and the poise of town life upon him, he
slipped into a swift review of changing conditions
and a vague speculation upon the value of environment
in the shaping of character. Lance was
all Lorrigan. He had turned Lorrigan in the two
years of his absence, which had somehow painted
out his resemblance to Belle. His hair had darkened
to a brown that was almost black. His eyes
had darkened, his mouth had the Lorrigan twist.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
He had grown taller, leaner, surer in his movements,&ndash;&ndash;due
to his enthusiasm for athletics and
the gym, though Tom had no means of knowing
what had given him that catlike quickness, the
grace of perfect muscular coordination. Tom
thought it was the Lorrigan blood building Lance
true to his forbears as he passed naturally from
youth to maturity. He wondered if Lance, given
the environment which had shaped his grandfather,
would have been a &#8220;killer,&#8221; hated by many,
feared by all.</p>
<p>Even now, if it came to the point of fighting,
would not Lance fight true to the blood, true to
that Lorrigan trick of the folded arms and the
tapping fingers? Would not Lance&ndash;&ndash;? Tom
pulled his thoughts away from following that last
conjecture to its logical end. There were matters
in which it might be best not to include Lance,
just as he had been careful not to include Belle.
For Lance might still be a good deal like Belle, in
spite of his Lorrigan looks and mannerisms.
And there were certain Lorrigan traits which
would not bear any mixture of Belle in the fiber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, that&#8217;s all made out. I&#8217;ll send to
Salt Lake and get the stuff quicker. Wake up,
Tom, and tell us how long it will take to put up the
schoolhouse? Lance is going to give the dance&ndash;&ndash;and
there won&#8217;t be so much as a soggy chocolate
cake accepted from the Rimmers. What will
you do, Lance? Put up a notice in Jumpoff?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Surely! A mysteriously worded affair, telling
little and saying much. Music and refresh&ndash;&ndash;no,
by heck, that sounds too wet and not solid
enough. Music and supper furnished free. Everybody
welcome. Can&#8217;t Riley drive the chuck-wagon
over and have the supper served by a camp-fire?
Golly, but I&#8217;ve been hungry for that old
chuck-wagon! That would keep all the mess of
coffee and sandwiches out of the nice, new schoolhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to hold their hat in front of the
nice, new schoolhouse till it&#8217;s done and ready?
And how&#8217;re you going to let &#8217;em know where to
come to, without giving away the secret?&#8221; Al,
the practical, stretched his long legs to the stove
and thrust his hands deep into his trousers pockets
while he propounded these two conundrums.
&#8220;Go on, Lance. This is yore party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance unfolded his arms and disposed his big
body on a bearskin covered lounge where he could
take Belle&#8217;s hand and pat it and playfully pinch
a finger now and then.</p>
<p>&#8220;To look at your hand, Belle, a fellow would
swear that a blonde manicure girl comes here twice
a week,&#8221; he said idly. &#8220;Where is the schoolhouse
going to be built? Why not put it just at the foot
of the ridge, at Cottonwood Spring? That&#8217;s out
of sight of the road, and if the notice said &#8216;Cottonwood
Spring&#8217;, folks would know where to head for.
It&#8217;s close to the line of your land, isn&#8217;t it, dad? A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
yard&ndash;&ndash;corral-size&ndash;&ndash;fenced around the place
would keep the cattle off the doorstep, and they
could water there just the same. If we&#8217;re going
to do it, why not do it right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we could get down there with a load,&#8221;
Tom assented easily. &#8220;I&#8217;d ruther have it on my
land anyways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think, Tom Lorrigan, that we&#8217;d ever
take it back from Mary Hope. No matter how
Scotty acts up. But if they ever gave her the
double-cross and got some one else to teach&ndash;&ndash;why
it might be nice to know it&#8217;s our schoolhouse, on our
land.&#8221; Belle pulled her hand away from Lance
and went over to the piano. &#8220;It&#8217;s all done but
the shingling,&#8221; she said cheerfully. &#8220;Come on,
Lance, see if you can sing &#8216;Asleep in the Deep.&#8217;
And then show me what you mean by saying you
can yodel now better than when I licked you the
time you and Duke chased the colt through the
corral fence!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All done but the shingling&ndash;&ndash;and I ain&#8217;t got
&#8217;em bought yet!&#8221; grumbled Tom, but was utterly
disregarded in the sonorous chords of Belle&#8217;s prelude
to the song.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>
<h3>LANCE RIDES AHEAD</h3>
</div>
<p>At fifteen minutes to four on a certain Tuesday
afternoon, the first really pleasant day after
the day of tearing, whooping wind that had blown
Tom into the role of school bully, Lance loped out
upon the trail that led past the Whipple shack a
mile and a quarter farther on. Ostensibly his
destination was the town of Jumpoff, although
it was not the time of day when one usually started
from the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch to the post-office,
with three unimportant letters as an excuse for
the trip.</p>
<p>As he rode Lance sang lustily a love song, but
he was not thinking especially of Mary Hope. In
two years more than one California girl had
briefly held his fancy, and memory of Mary Hope
had slightly dimmed. In his pocket were two letters,
addressed to two California towns. One letter
had Miss Helene Somebody inscribed upon it,
and on the other was Miss Mildred Somebody Else.
The love song, therefore, had no special significance,
save that Lance was young and perfectly
normal and liked the idea of love, without being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
hampered by any definite form of it concentrated
upon one girl.</p>
<p>For all that he had timed his trip so as to arrive
at the Whipple shack just about the time when
Mary Hope would be starting home. He was curious
to see just how much or how little she had
changed; to know whether she still had that funny
little Scotch accent that manifested itself in certain
phrasings, certain vowel sounds at variance
with good English pronunciation. He wanted to
know just how much Pocatello had done to spoil
her. Beneath all was the primal instinct of the
young male dimly seeking the female whom his
destiny had ordained to be his mate.</p>
<p>As a young fellow shut in behind the Rim, with
the outside world a vast area over which his imagination
wandered vaguely, Mary Hope had appealed
to him. She was the one girl in the Black
Rim country whom he would ride out of his way
to meet, whose face, whose voice, lingered with him
pleasantly for days after he had seen her and
talked with her. He reflected, between snatches
of song, that he might have thought himself in
love with Mary Hope, might even have married
her, had Belle not suddenly decided that he should
go beyond the Rim and learn the things she could
not teach him. Belle must have wanted him, her
youngest, to be different from the rest. He wondered
with a sudden whimsical smile, whether she
was satisfied with the result of his two years of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
exile. Tom, he suspected, was not,&ndash;&ndash;nor were
Duke and Al. The three seemed to hold themselves
apart from him, to look upon him as a guest
rather than as one of the family returned after an
absence. They did not include him in their talk
of range matters and the business of the ranch.
He had once observed in them a secret embarrassment
when he appeared unexpectedly, had detected
a swift change of tone and manner and subject.</p>
<p>Surely they could not think he had changed
sufficiently to make him an outsider, he meditated.
Aside from his teasing of Belle, he had dropped
deliberately into the range vernacular, refraining
only from certain crudities of speech which grated
on his ears. He had put on his old clothes, he
had tried to take his old place in the ranch work.
He had driven a four-horse team up the Ridge
trail with lumber for the schoolhouse, and had negotiated
the rock descent to Cottonwood Spring
with a skill that pleased him mightily because it
proved to him&ndash;&ndash;and to Tom and the boys&ndash;&ndash;that
his range efficiency had not lessened during his
absence. He had done everything the boys had
done, except ride out with them on certain long
trips over the range. He had not gone simply because
they had made it quite plain that they did not
want him.</p>
<p>Nor did the hired cowboys want him with them,&ndash;&ndash;ten
of them in the bunk house with a cook of
their own, and this only the middle of March! In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
two years the personnel of the bunk house had
changed almost completely. They were men
whom he did not know, men who struck him as
&#8220;hard-boiled,&#8221; though he could not have explained
just wherein they differed from the others. Sam
Pretty Cow and Shorty he could hobnob with as of
yore,&ndash;&ndash;Sam in particular giving him much pleasure
with his unbroken reserve, his unreadable Indian
eyes and his wide-lipped grin. The others
were like Duke, Tom and Al,&ndash;&ndash;slightly aloof, a
bit guarded in their manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose Mary Hope will be absolutely
spoiled, with small-town dignity laid a foot deep
over her Scotch primness. Still, a girl that has
the nerve to lift a club and threaten to brain Tom
Lorrigan&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He had forgotten the love song he was singing,
and before he reached farther in his musings he
met the Swedes, who stared at him round-eyed and
did not answer his careless hello. A little farther,
the Boyle children rode up out of a dry wash,
grinned bashfully at him and hurried on.</p>
<p>A saddlehorse was tied to a post near the
Whipple shack. With long legs swinging slightly
with the stride of his horse, reins held high and
loose in one hand, his big hat tilted over his forehead,
Lance rode up and dismounted as if his errand,
though important, was not especially urgent.
The door stood open. He walked up, tapped twice
with his knuckles on the unpainted casing, and entered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
pulling off his hat and turning it round and
round in his gloved fingers while he ducked his
head, pressed his lips together with a humorous
quirk, shuffled his spurred feet on the dirty floor
and bowed again as awkwardly as he could. In
this manner he hoped to draw some little spark of
individuality from Mary Hope, who sat behind her
yellow-painted table and stared at him over her
folded arms. But Mary Hope, he observed, had
been crying, and compunction seized him suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221; she asked him curtly, rubbing
a palm down over one cheek, with the motion
obliterating a small rivulet of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, ma&#8217;am, I was sent to mend a lock
on a door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What lock? On what door?&#8221; Mary Hope
passed a palm down her other cheek, thus obliterating
another rivulet that had ceased to flow tears
and was merely wet and itchy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, ma&#8217;am, you can search me.&#8221;
Lance looked at her innocently. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t bring
any lock with me, and I didn&#8217;t bring any door with
me. But I&#8217;ve got some screws and three nails and&ndash;&ndash;lots
of good intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good intentions are very rare in this country,&#8221;
said Mary Hope, and made meaningless marks on
the bare tabletop with a blunt pencil.</p>
<p>Lance heard a twang of Scotch in the &#8220;very
rare&#8221; which pleased him. But he kept his position
by the doorway, and he continued bashfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
turning his big hat round and round against his
chest,&ndash;&ndash;though the action went oddly with the Lorrigan
look and the athletic poise of him. &#8220;Yes,
ma&#8217;am. Quite rare,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, I don&#8217;t believe there is such a thing in
the whole Black Rim country,&#8221; stated Mary Hope,
plainly nonplussed at his presence and behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I show you mine?&#8221; Lance advanced a
step. He was not sure, at that moment, whether
he wanted to go with the play. Mary Hope was
better looking than when he had seen her last.
She had lost a good deal of the rusticity he remembered
her to have possessed, but she was either too
antagonistic to carry on the farce, or she was waiting
for him to show his hand, to betray some self-consciousness.
But the fact that she looked at
him straight in the eyes and neither frowned nor
giggled, set her apart from the ordinary range-bred
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk like a country peddler. I&#8217;m willing to
accept a sample, and see if they are durable.
Though I can&#8217;t for the life of me see why you&#8217;d
be coming here with good intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be mending a lock on a door. Is this the
door, ma&#8217;am? And is this the lock?&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the door behind him was the only door
within five miles of them, and since the lock dangled
from a splintered casing, Mary Hope almost
smiled. &#8220;It is a door,&#8221; she informed him. &#8220;And
it is a lock that has been broken by a Lorrigan.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>She was baiting him, tempting him to quarrel
with her over the old grudge. Because she expected
a reply, Lance made no answer whatever.
He happened to have a dozen or so of nails in his
coat pocket, left-overs from his assiduous carpentry
on the house being builded for her comfort.
The screws he possessed were too large, and he had
no hammer. But no man worries over a missing
hammer where rocks are plentiful, and Lance was
presently pounding the lock into place, his back
to Mary Hope, his thoughts swinging from his
prospective party to the possible religious scruples
of the Douglas family.</p>
<p>Mary Hope used to dance&ndash;&ndash;a very little&ndash;&ndash;he
remembered, though she had not attended many
dances. He recalled suddenly that a Christmas
tree or a Fourth of July picnic had usually been
the occasions when Mary Hope, with her skirts
just hitting her shoe tops in front and sagging in
an ungainly fashion behind, had teetered solemnly
through a &#8220;square&#8221; dance with him. Mother
Douglas herself had always sat very straight and
prim on a bench, her hands folded in her lap and
her eyes blinking disapprovingly at the ungodly
ones who let out an exultant little yip now and then
when they started exuberantly through the mazes
of the &#8220;gran&#8217;-right-n-left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would Mary Hope attend the party? Should
he tell her about it and ask her to come? Naturally,
he could not peacefully escort her partyward,&ndash;&ndash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
feud was still too rancorous for that. Or
was it? At the Devil&#8217;s Tooth they spoke of old
Scotty as an enemy, but they had cited no particular
act of hostility as evidence of his enmity.
At the Devil&#8217;s Tooth they spoke of the whole Black
Rim country as enemy&#8217;s country. Lance began to
wonder if it were possible that the Lorrigans had
adopted unconsciously the role of black sheep,
without the full knowledge or concurrence of the
Black Rimmers.</p>
<p>He did what he could to make a workable lock
of one that had been ready to fall to pieces before
his father heaved against it; hammered in the loosened
screws in the hinges, tossed the rock out into
the scuffed sod before the shack, and picked up
his hat. He had not once looked toward Mary
Hope, but he turned now as if he were going to
say good-by and take himself off; as if mending
the lock had really been his errand, and no further
interest held him there.</p>
<p>He surprised a strange, wistful look in Mary
Hope&#8217;s eyes, a trembling of her lips. She seemed
to be waiting, fearing that he meant to go without
any further overtures toward friendship.</p>
<p>The Whipple shack was not large. Ten feet
spanned the distance between them. Impulsively
Lance covered that distance in three steps. At
the table he stopped, leaned toward her with his
palms braced upon the table, and stared full into
Mary Hope&#8217;s disturbed eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Girl,&#8221; he said, drawing the word softly along
a vibrant note in his voice that sent a tremor
through her, &#8220;Girl, you&#8217;re more lonesome than
Scotch, and you&#8217;re more Scotch than the heather
that grows in your front yard to make your mother
cry for the Highlands she sees when her eyes
blur with homesickness. You were crying when I
came&ndash;&ndash;crying because you&#8217;re lonely. It&#8217;s a big,
wild country&ndash;&ndash;the Black Rim. It&#8217;s a country for
men to ride hell-whooping through the sage and
camas grass, with guns slung at their hips, but
it&#8217;s no country for a little person like you to try
and carry on a feud because her father made one.
You&#8217;re&ndash;&ndash;too little!&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not touch her, his face did not come near
her face. But in his eyes, in his voice, in the
tender, one-sided little smile, there was something,&ndash;&ndash;Mary
Hope caught her breath, feeling as if she
had been kissed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little, lonesome girl! There&#8217;s going to
be a party at Cottonwood Spring, a week from Friday
night. It&#8217;s a secret&ndash;&ndash;a secret for you. And
you won&#8217;t tell a soul that you were the first to
know&ndash;&ndash;and you&#8217;ll come, you girl, because it&#8217;s
your party. And not a soul will know it&#8217;s your
party. If your father&#8217;s Scotch is too hard for
dancing&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll come just the same. You&#8217;ll
come, because the secret is for you. And&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
thought that he read something in her eyes and
hastened to forestall her intention &#8220;&ndash;&ndash;and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
won&#8217;t go near Cottonwood Spring before the time
of the party, because that wouldn&#8217;t be playing fair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be lonely, girl. The world is full of
pleasant things, just waiting to pop out at you
from behind every bush. If you&#8217;re good and kind
and honest with life, the Fates are going to give
you the best they&#8217;ve got. Don&#8217;t be lonely! Just
wait for the pleasant things in to-morrow and to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;in
all the to-morrows. And one of
them, girl, is going to show you the sweetest thing
in life. That&#8217;s love, you girl with the tears back
of your Scotch blue eyes. But wait for it&ndash;&ndash;and
take the little pleasant things that minutes have
hidden away in the to-morrows. And one of the
pleasant times will be hidden at Cottonwood
Spring, a week from Friday night. Wonder what
it will be, girl. And if any one tries to tell it, put
your hands over your ears, so that you won&#8217;t hear
it. Wait&ndash;&ndash;and keep wondering, and come to Cottonwood
Spring next Friday night. Adios, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked into her eyes, smiling a little. Then,
turning suddenly, he left her without a backward
glance. Left her with nothing to spoil the haunting
cadence of his voice, nothing to lift the spell
of tender prophecy his words had laid upon her
soul. When he was quite gone, when she heard
the clatter of his horse&#8217;s hoofs upon the arid soil
that surrounded the Whipple shack, Mary Hope
still stared out through the open doorway, seeing
nothing of the March barrenness, seeing only the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
tender, inscrutable, tantalizing face of Lance Lorrigan,&ndash;&ndash;tantalizing
because she could not plumb
the depths of his eyes, could not say how much of
the tenderness was meant for her, how much was
born of the deep music of his voice, the whimsical,
one-sided smile.</p>
<p>And Lance, when he had ridden a furlong from
the place, had dipped into a shallow draw and
climbed the other side, turned half around in the
saddle and looked back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, why did I go off and leave her like that?
Like an actor walking off the stage to make room
for the other fellow to come on and say his lines.
There&#8217;s no other fellow&ndash;&ndash;thank heck! And here
are two miles we might be riding together&ndash;&ndash;and
me preaching to her about taking the little, pleasant
things that come unexpectedly!&#8221; He swung
his horse around in the trail, meaning to ride back;
retraced his steps as far as the hollow, and turned
again, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody could stop at the schoolhouse just as
school&#8217;s out, and ride a couple of miles down the
road with the schoolma&#8217;am&ndash;&ndash;if she let him do it!
Anybody could do that. But that isn&#8217;t the reason,
why I&#8217;m riding on ahead. What the hell is the
reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped again on the high level where he
could look back and see the Whipple shack squatted
forlornly in the gray stretch of sage with wide,
brown patches of dead grass between the bushes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Lonesome,&#8221; he named the wild expanse of unpeopled
range land. &#8220;She&#8217;s terribly lonely&ndash;&ndash;and
sweet. Too lonely and sweet for me to play
with, to ride a few miles with&ndash;&ndash;and leave her
lonelier than I found her. I couldn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s
enough sadness now in those Scotch blue eyes.
Damned if I&#8217;ll add more!&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw Mary Hope come from the shack, pause
a minute on the doorstep, then walk out to where
her horse was tied to the post. He lifted the reins,
pricked his horse gently with the spurs and galloped
away to Jumpoff, singing no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>
<h3>SHE WILL, AND SHE WON&#8217;T</h3>
</div>
<p>Cottonwood Spring was a dished-out
oasis just under the easy slope of Devil&#8217;s
Tooth Ridge. From no part of the Jumpoff trail
could it be seen, and the surrounding slope did not
offer much inducement to cattle in March, when
water was plentiful; wherefore riders would
scarcely wander into the saucer-like hollow that
contained the cottonwoods and the spring. A picnic
had once been held there, but the festivities had
been marred by a severe thunderstorm that came
just as a wordy quarrel between two drunken cowpunchers
was fast nearing the gun-pulling stage.
Lightning had struck the side hill just beyond the
grove, and the shock of it had knocked down and
stunned the two disputants, and three saddle
horses standing in the muddy overflow from the
spring. For this reason, perhaps, and because it
was on Lorrigan land, the place had never thereafter
been frequented save by the stock that watered
there.</p>
<p>But from the head of the little basin a wide
view was had of the broken land beyond Devil&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
Tooth. The spring was clear and cold and never
affected by drouth. By following the easy slope
around the point of the main trail from Jumpoff
to the Lorrigan ranch, no road-building was necessary,
and in summer the cottonwoods looked
very cool and inviting&ndash;&ndash;though at certain times
they harbored buffalo gnats and many red ants
that would bite, which rendered the shade less
grateful than it looked. But to the Lorrigans it
seemed an ideal site for a schoolhouse.</p>
<p>Ten days after they had planned the deed, the
schoolhouse stood ready for the dance. In the
lean-to shed, twelve shiny yellow desks that smelled
strongly of varnish were stacked in their heavy
paper swaddlings, waiting to be set in place when
the dance was done. Belle herself had hemmed
scrim curtains for the windows, which Riley had
washed copiously. The blackboard, with the
names of various Devil&#8217;s Tooth men and a
&#8220;motto&#8221; or two scrawled upon it was in place;
the globe was on the teacher&#8217;s desk, and the water
bucket on its shelf in the corner, with a shiny new
tin dipper hanging on a nail above it.</p>
<p>If you were to believe the frequent declarations,
every puncher on the ranch had done his durnedest
to put &#8217;er up, and put &#8217;er up right. Sam Pretty
Cow had nailed a three-foot American flag to the
front gable, and had landed on a nail when he
jumped from the eaves. On the night of the dance
he was hobbling around the chuck-wagon with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
half a pound of salt pork bound to his foot, helping
Riley, who had driven over to the spring early,
burdened with the importance of his share in the
entertainment.</p>
<p>A dance in the Black Rim country has all the
effect of a dog fight in a small village with empty
streets. No sooner does it start than one wonders
where all the people came from.</p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock toiling horses drawing full loads
of humanity began to appear over the rim of the
hollow, to pick their way carefully down toward
the lighted windows, urged by their drivers. Men
on horseback made the descent more swiftly, with
a clatter of small rocks kicked loose as they came.
They encountered a four-wire fence, circled it to
where a lantern, hung on a post, revealed a gate
that lay flat on the ground to leave a welcoming
space for teams and saddle horses to pass through.</p>
<p>Beside the schoolhouse, with two lanterns shedding
a yellow glow on his thin, sandy hair, Riley,
at the chuck-wagon, arranged doughnuts, sandwiches,
pies and cakes to his liking, wiped his red
hands frequently on his clean flour-sack apron, and
held carefully unprofane conversation with the
women who came fluttering over to him, their arms
burdened.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mom, sorry! I know I&#8217;m turnin&#8217; down
something that&#8217;s better than anything I got here,
but this here party&#8217;s on the Lorrigans. No, mom,
I got orders not to take in s&#8217;much as a sour pickle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
from nobody. You jest put it back in the rig,
whatever you got there, and consider&#8217;t you got
some Sat&#8217;day bakin&#8217; did up ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mom, it&#8217;s Lance&#8217;s party. He&#8217;s home for
a visit, an&#8217; he kinda wanted to have a dance an&#8217;
meet the folks, seein&#8217; he&#8217;s been away quite a spell
and kain&#8217;t stay long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mom, he&#8217;s goin&#8217; back to college first the
week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey! I wisht you&#8217;d tie up yore cayuses other
side the shack. Folks&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; around here for
their supper, and they don&#8217;t wanta git their faces
kicked off whilst they&#8217;re huntin&#8217; grub to fill &#8217;em.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mom, we ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; any cakes or nothin&#8217;
off nobody. Lance, he wanted to give this dance
an&#8217; give it <i>right</i>. Ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to cost nobody a
thing but sore corns, t&#8217;night!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance had hired an Italian violinist and his boy
who played a harp much taller than himself and
people coming from Jumpoff had brought them
out. The Millers had come, with all their outfit.
The AJ outfit was there to a man. The Swedes
were present, sitting together in the corner by the
water bucket, and the Conleys, who lived over by
Camas Creek beyond the AJ, had come. The Conleys
had sheep, and were not firmly settled in the
Black Rim, sheepmen being looked at askance.
There were families from nearer Jumpoff,&ndash;&ndash;one
really did wonder where they all came from, when
the country seemed so wide and unpeopled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>Lance was surprised to see how many were there
who were total strangers. Until the dancing began
the men stood outside and smoked, leaving
the women and children to arrange themselves on
benches along the wall inside. Lance knew the
custom well enough, and he did not go in. But
he tried to see who came with every load that was
deposited within the circle of light on the narrow
platform that embellished the front.</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock, when the musicians were trying
their instruments tentatively and even the most
reluctant male was being drawn irresistibly to the
humming interior, Lance frankly admitted to himself
that he was not happy, and that his condition
was the direct result of not having seen Mary Hope
enter the door.</p>
<p>He sought out Tom, who was over at the chuck-wagon,
taking an early cup of coffee. Tom blew
away the steam that rose on the chill night air
and eyed Lance. &#8220;Well, when do we make the
speech? Or don&#8217;t we?&#8221; he demanded, taking a
gulp and finding the coffee still too hot for comfort.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me to; I done my share when I built
&#8217;er. You can tell the bunch what she&#8217;s for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what the heck do we want with a speech?&#8221;
Lance remonstrated. &#8220;They know it&#8217;s a schoolhouse,
unless they&#8217;re blind. And I thought maybe
some one&ndash;&ndash;you, probably, since you&#8217;re the one
who hazed her out of the other place&ndash;&ndash;would just
tell Mary Hope to bring her books over here and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
teach. And I thought, to cinch it, you could tell
Jim Boyle that you felt you ought to do something
toward a school, and since you couldn&#8217;t furnish
any kids, you thought you&#8217;d furnish the house.
That ought to be easy. It&#8217;s up to you, I should
say. But I wouldn&#8217;t make any speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom grunted, finished his coffee and proceeded
to remove all traces of it from his lips with his best
white handkerchief. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Jim Boyle at?&#8221;
he asked, moving into the wide bar of dusk that
lay between the lights of the chuck-wagon and the
glow from the two windows facing that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;d speak about it first to Mary
Hope,&#8221; Lance suggested, coming behind him.
&#8220;But she hasn&#8217;t come yet&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>As if she heard and deliberately moved to contradict
him, Mary Hope danced past the window,
the hand of a strange young man with a crisp white
handkerchief pressed firmly between her shoulder
blades. Mary Hope was dancing almost as solemnly
as in the days of short skirts and sleek hair,
her eyes apparently fixed upon the shoulder of her
partner who gazed straight out over her head, his
whole mind centered upon taking the brunt of collisions
upon the point of his upraised elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ketch her when she&#8217;s through dancing,&#8221;
promised Tom. But Lance had another thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell Mary Hope, dad. I&#8217;m going to
dance with her, and it will be easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the darkness Tom grinned and went on to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
find Jim Boyle standing in a group of older men
on the platform that served as a porch. Jim Boyle
was smoking a cheap cigar brought out from
Jumpoff by the section boss. He listened reflectively,
looked at the glowing tip of the evil-smelling
cigar, threw the thing from him and reached for
his cigarette papers with an oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s damn white of yuh, Tom,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I leave it to the boys if it ain&#8217;t damn white. Not
having no school district I&#8217;m puttin&#8217; up the money
outa my own pocket to pay the teacher. And
havin&#8217; four kids to feed and buy clothes for, I
couldn&#8217;t afford to build no schoolhouse, I tell yuh
those. And uh course, I didn&#8217;t like to go round
askin&#8217; fer help; but it&#8217;s damn white of yuh to step
in an&#8217; do yore share towards making the Rim look
like it was civilized. Sederson, he&#8217;ll feel the same
way about it. And I&#8217;m gitting a foreman that&#8217;s
got a kid, school age; we sure&#8217;n hell do need a
schoolhouse. Rim&#8217;s settlin&#8217; up fast. I always
said, Tom, that you was white. I leave it to the
boys here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside, Lance was not finding it so easy to make
the announcement. Last Tuesday, Mary Hope
had not understood just why he had ridden on
ahead of her for two miles&ndash;&ndash;she could see the
small dust cloud kicked up by his horse on the
Jumpoff trail, so there could be no mistake&ndash;&ndash;when
he knew perfectly well that she must ride
that way, when he could not have failed to see her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
horse saddled and waiting at the door. It seemed
to Mary Hope an obscure form of mockery to tell
her not to be lonely&ndash;&ndash;to tell her in a caressing
tone that left with her all the effect of kisses&ndash;&ndash;and
then to ride away without one backward glance,
one word of excuse. Until she had mounted and had
seen him on the trail ahead, she had not realized
how he had mocked her.</p>
<p>For days&ndash;&ndash;until Friday, to be explicit&ndash;&ndash;she
had been quite determined not to go near Cottonwood
Spring. Then she had suddenly changed
her mind, dismissed school half an hour early,
put old Rab in a lather on the way home, dressed
herself and announced to her mother that she
must ride into Jumpoff for school supplies, and
that she would stay all night with the Kennedys.
It had taken two years and the dignity of school-teacher
to give Mary Hope the courage to announce
things to her mother. As it was, she permitted
her mother to explain as best she might
to Hugh Douglas. Her courage did not reach to
that long, uncompromising upper lip of her
father&#8217;s.</p>
<p>She had folded her prettiest dress carefully into
a flat bundle, had thrown it out of her window and
left the house in her riding clothes. There was a
saddle horse, Jamie, a Roman-nosed bay of uncertain
temper and a high, rocking gait, which she
sometimes used for long trips. She saddled him
now and hurried away, thankful to be gone with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
her package and her guilty conscience before her
father arrived. She was very good friends with
the Kennedys, at the section house. If there was
a dance within forty miles, the Kennedys might
be counted upon to attend; and that is how Mary
Hope arrived at the schoolhouse with a load from
Jumpoff. She had seen Lance standing near the
door, and Lance had paid no attention to her, but
had left an AJ man to claim the first two-step.
Wherefore Lance walked straight into trouble
when he went to Mary Hope and asked for the next
dance with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;So sorry&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s promised already,&#8221; said Mary
Hope, in her primmest tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a dance after the next one,&#8221; he hinted,
looking down from his more-than-six feet at her
where she sat wedged between Mrs. Boyle and
Jennie Miller.</p>
<p>&#8220;So sorry&ndash;&ndash;but I think that one is promised
also,&#8221; said Mary Hope.</p>
<p>Lance drew a corner of his lip between his teeth,
let it go and lifted his eyebrows whimsically at
Jennie Miller, whom he had once heard playing
on her organ, and whom he had detested ever since
with an unreasoning animosity born solely of her
musical inability and her long neck that had on its
side a brown mole with three coarse hairs in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Miss Douglas has two dances engaged in
advance, it&#8217;s quite hopeless to hope for a dance
with Miss Miller,&#8221; he said, maliciously drawing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
the sentence through certain vibrant tones which
experience had taught him had a certain pleasing
effect upon persons. &#8220;Or is it hopeless? Are
you engaged for every dance to-night, Miss Miller?
And if you are, please may I stand beside you
while you eat a sandwich at midnight?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie Miller giggled. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t as popular as
all that,&#8221; she retorted, glancing at Mary Hope,
sitting very straight and pretty beside her. &#8220;And
if I was, I don&#8217;t go and promise everybody that
asks. I might want to change my mind afterwards
if some other fellow comes along I liked
better&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;ve saw too many fights start over
a girl forgetting who she&#8217;s promised to dance
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to see a fight start now, do
you?&#8221; Lance smiled down at her without in the
least degree betraying to Mary Hope that he would
like to pull Jennie Miller by force from that seat
and occupy it himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never can see why men fight over things. I
hate fights,&#8221; Miss Miller stammered, agitated by
a wild feeling that perhaps she was going to be
made love to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t forget that you are going to dance
with me.&#8221; The music just then started again,
and he offered her his arm with a certain import
that made Mary Hope clench her hands.</p>
<p>Mary Hope was punished for her lie. She had
not promised that dance, and so she sat on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
plank bench and saw Lance and Jennie Miller sway
past her four times before a gawky youth who
worked for her father caught sight of her and came
over from the water-bucket corner to ask her for
the dance. That was not the worst. On the fourth
round of Lance and Jennie, and just as the gawky
one was bowing stiffly before her, Lance looked at
her over Jennie Miller&#8217;s shoulder, and smiled that
tantalizing, Lorrigan smile that always left her uneasily
doubtful of its meaning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>
<h3>A WAY HE HAD WITH HIM</h3>
</div>
<p>It was at the chuck-wagon at midnight, while
Riley and Sam Pretty Cow were serving tin
cups of black coffee to a shuffling, too-hilarious
crowd, that Lance next approached Mary Hope.
She was standing on the outskirts of a group composed
mostly of women, quite alone so far as cavaliers
were concerned, for the gawky youth had
gone after coffee. She was looking toward the
sagebrush camp-fire around which a crowd of men
had gathered with much horseplay at which they
were laughing loudly, and she was wondering how
best she could make Lance Lorrigan aware of her
absolute indifference to him, when his voice
drawled disconcertingly close to her ear:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not lonely now, you girl&ndash;&ndash;and you did
find a secret at Cottonwood Spring. A pleasant
little secret, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope&#8217;s hands became fists at her side,
held close against her best frock. &#8220;I think the
fellows over by the fire have discovered your pleasant
secret,&#8221; she said, and did not turn her face
toward him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>With his arms folded and his eyebrows pulled
together and his lip between his teeth, Lance stared
down at her face, studying it in the flicker of the
distant firelight and the two lanterns. If her combativeness
roused in him any resentment, he did
not permit it to show in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the fellows from Jumpoff brought a
bottle or two. That&#8217;s no secret, except that I
don&#8217;t know where they have it cach&eacute;d. The schoolhouse
is your&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard it was included in the Lorrigan refreshments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The schoolhouse is ready for your pleasure
Monday morning,&#8221; Lance spoke with that perfect
impersonal courtesy that is so exasperating to a
person who listens for something to resent. &#8220;I
knew of it, of course&ndash;&ndash;dad wanted it kept for a
surprise. And he wanted me to tell you. It&#8217;s the
Lorrigan expression of their appreciation of the
need of a school.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gawky youth came stumbling up, his outstretched
hands carefully holding two tin cups
filled with coffee close to the boiling point. Being
a youth of good intentions, he tried very hard not
to spill a drop. Being gawky, he stubbed his toe
as he was rounding the group of women, and Mrs.
Miller shrieked and swung back her hand, cuffing
the gawky one straight into the thickest of the
crowd. Other women screamed.</p>
<p>Lance reached a long arm and plucked the youth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
out by the slack of his coat, shook him and propelled
him into the darkness, where he collided
violently with Sam Pretty Cow. Some one had
been over-generous with Sam Pretty Cow. A
drunken Indian is never quite safe. Sam Pretty
Cow struck out blindly, yelling Piegan curses
hoarsely as he fought. The crowd of men around
the camp-fire came running. For a short space
there was confusion, shouting, the shrill voices of
scalded women denouncing the accident as a deliberate
outrage.</p>
<p>Mrs. Miller whirled on Lance. &#8220;You pushed
him on me! If that ain&#8217;t a Lorrigan trick!&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&ndash;&ndash;what yuh mean? Throwin&#8217; bilin&#8217; hot
coffee on&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says it&#8217;s a Lorrigan trick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might &#8217;a&#8217; known what to expect&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back here, away from the crowd. There
may be shooting,&#8221; Lance muttered to Mary Hope,
and pulled her to the rear of the wagon and around
upon the farther side. She could not resist. His
strength was beyond any hope of combating it
with her small strength. Mrs. Miller, whose
scalded shoulder led her to wild utterances without
thought of their effect upon others, shouted at him
as he hustled Mary Hope away:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&ndash;&ndash;<i>run!</i> You&#8217;re the one that done it&ndash;&ndash;now
run! That&#8217;s like a Lorrigan&ndash;&ndash;do your dirty
work and then crawl out and let somebody else
take the blame! That kid never&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Aw, come back and fight, you big sneak!&#8221; A
drunken voice bellowed hoarsely, and a gunshot
punctuated the command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on&ndash;&ndash;get on the other side of the schoolhouse.
Run! The fools will all start to shooting
now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope stopped stubbornly. &#8220;I will not!&#8221;
she defied him; and Lance without more argument
lifted her from the ground, stooped and tossed her
under the wagon, much as he would have heaved
a bag of oats out of the rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you move until I tell you to,&#8221; he commanded
her harshly, and ran back, diving into the
thick of the crowd as though he were charging
into a football scrimmage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it called me back to fight? Put up
your guns,&ndash;&ndash;or keep them if you like. It&#8217;s all one
to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the dim light he saw the gleam of a weapon
raised before him, reached out and wrenched it
away from the owner, and threw it far over his
shoulder into the weeds. &#8220;Who said a Lorrigan
run? I want that man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said it,&#8221; bellowed a whisky-flushed man
whose face was strange to him. &#8220;I said it, and I
say it agin. I say&ndash;&ndash;a Lorrigan!&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his gun above the pressure of excited
men and women. Lance sprung upward and forward,
landed on some one&#8217;s foot, lunged again and
got a grip on the hand that held the gun. With his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
left hand he wrenched the gun away. With his
right he pulled the man free of the crowd and out
where there was room. The crowd&ndash;&ndash;men, now,
for the women had fled shrieking&ndash;&ndash;surged that
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back there! I&#8217;ll settle with this fellow
alone.&#8221; He held the other fast, his arms as merciless
as the grip of a grizzly, and called aloud:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a Lorrigan dance, and the Lorrigans are
going to have order. Those of you who brought
chips on your shoulders, and whisky to soak the
chips in, can drink your whisky and do your fighting
among yourselves, off the Lorrigan ranch.
We all came here to have fun. There&#8217;s music and
room to dance, and plenty of chuck and plenty of
coffee, and the dance is going right on without any
fuss whatever.</p>
<p>&#8220;This poor boob here who thinks he wants to
fight me just because I&#8217;m a Lorrigan, I never saw
before. It wouldn&#8217;t be a fair fight, because he&#8217;s
too drunk to do anything but make a fool of himself.
There&#8217;s nothing to fight about, anyway. A
fellow was carrying two cups of boiling hot coffee,
and he stubbed his toe, and some one got scalded
a little. That&#8217;s nothing to break up a dance over.
The rest of you heard the noise and jumped at the
conclusion there was trouble afoot. There isn&#8217;t.
I think you all want to go on with the dance and
have a good time, except perhaps a few who are
drunk. They are at liberty to go off somewhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
and beat each other up to their hearts&#8217; content.
Come on, now, folks&ndash;&ndash;get your partners for a
square dance&ndash;&ndash;and <i>everybody dance!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice had held them listening. His words
were not the words of a coward, yet they were a
plea for peace, they seemed reasonable even to the
half-drunken ones who had been the readiest to
fight. The old-time range slogan, &#8220;<i>Everybody
dance!</i>&#8221; sent three or four hurrying to find the
girls they wanted. The trouble, it would appear,
had ended as suddenly as it had begun and for a
moment the tension relaxed.</p>
<p>The drunken one was still cursing, struggling
unavailingly to tear himself away from Lance so
that he could land a blow. Lance, looking out
across the crowd, caught Belle&#8217;s glance and nodded
toward the schoolhouse. Belle hurried away to
find the musicians and set them playing, and a few
couples strayed after her. But there were men
who stayed, pushing, elbowing to see what would
happen when Lance Lorrigan loosened his hold on
the Jumpoff man.</p>
<p>Lance did not loosen his hold, however. He saw
Tom, Al, three or four Devil&#8217;s Tooth men edging
up, and sent them a warning shake of his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows this fellow? Where does he belong?
I think his friends had better take care of
him until he sobers up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take care of him,&#8221; said another stranger,
easing up to Lance. &#8220;He won&#8217;t hurt yuh; he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
only foolin&#8217;, anyway. Bill Kennedy, he always
gits kinda happy when he&#8217;s had one or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was laughter in the crowd. Two or three
voices were heard muttering together, and other
laughs followed. Some one produced a bottle and
offered the pugnacious one a drink. Lance let him
go with a contemptuous laugh and went to where
the Devil&#8217;s Tooth men now stood bunched close
together, their backs to the chuck-wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to clean up this crowd, before it&#8217;s
over,&#8221; Al was saying to his father. &#8220;Might as
well start right in and git &#8217;er over with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have it said the Lorrigans can&#8217;t give a
dance without having it end in rough-house!&#8221;
Lance interrupted. &#8220;Cut out the idea of fighting
that bunch. Keep them out of the house and away
from the women, and let them have their booze
down in the grove. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve seen a lot
of them heading. Come on, boys; it takes just as
much nerve not to fight as it does to kill off a
dozen men. Isn&#8217;t that right, dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More,&#8221; said Tom laconically. &#8220;No, boys, we
don&#8217;t want no trouble here. Come on in and
dance. That&#8217;s yore job&ndash;&ndash;to keep &#8217;er moving
peaceable. I&#8217;ll fire any man I ketch drinking
Jumpoff booze. We&#8217;ve got better at the ranch.
Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way and his men followed him,&ndash;&ndash;not
as though they were particularly anxious to avoid
trouble, but more like men who are trained to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
obey implicitly a leader who has some definite purpose
and refuses to be turned from it. Lance,
walking a few steps in the rear, wondered at the
discipline his father seemed to maintain without
any apparent effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they say the Lorrigans are a tough outfit!&#8221;
he laughed, when he had overtaken Tom.
&#8220;Dad, you&#8217;ve got the bunch trained like soldiers.
I was more afraid our boys would rough things up
than I was worried over the stews.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! When we rough things up, it&#8217;s when
<i>we</i> want it rough. Al, he was kinda excited. But
at that, we may have to hogtie a few of them smart
Alecks from town, before we can dance peaceable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope, Lance discovered, was already in
the schoolhouse. Also, several of the intoxicated
were there, and the quadrille was being danced
with so much zest that the whole building shook.
That in itself was not unusual&ndash;&ndash;Black Rim dances
usually did become rather boisterous after supper&ndash;&ndash;but
just outside the door a bottle was being circulated
freely, and two or three men had started
toward the cottonwood grove for more. Duke,
coming up to Lance where he stood in the doorway,
pulled him to one side, where they could not be
overheard.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be trouble here, sure&#8217;s you&#8217;re
knee-high to a duck. Dad won&#8217;t let our bunch
light into &#8217;em, but they&#8217;ll be fighting amongst
themselves inside an hour. You better slip it to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
the women that the dance breaks up early. Give
&#8217;em a few more waltzes and two-steps, Lance, and
then make it Home-Sweet-Home, if you don&#8217;t
want to muss up your nice city clothes,&#8221; he added,
with a laugh that was not altogether friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mussing up nice city clothes is my favorite
pastime,&#8221; Lance retorted, and went inside again
to see who was doing all the whooping. The chief
whooper, he discovered, was Bill Kennedy, the
man whom he had very nearly thrashed. Mary
Hope was looking her Scotch primmest. Lance
measured the primness, saw that there was a vacant
space beside her, and made his precarious way
toward it, circling the dancers who swung close to
the benches and trod upon the toes of the wall
flowers in their enthusiasm. He reached the vacant
space and sat down just in time to receive Bill
Kennedy in his lap. But Bill was too happy just
then to observe whose lap he landed in, and
bounced up with a bellowing laugh to resume his
gyrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dance any more, girl,&#8221; Lance said, leaning
so that he could make himself heard without
shouting in the uproar. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting pretty wild&ndash;&ndash;and
it will be wilder. They must have hauled it
out in barrels!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope looked at him, but she did not smile,
did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry the secret is no nicer,&#8221; Lance went
on. &#8220;Now the floor will have to be scrubbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
before a lady girl can come out and teach school
here. I thought it would be great to have a house-warming
dance,&ndash;&ndash;but they&#8217;re making it too
blamed warm!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some one slipped and fell, and immediately
there was a struggling heap where others had
fallen over the first. There were shrieks of laughter
and an oath or two, an epithet and then a loud-flung
threat.</p>
<p>Lance started up, saw that Tom and Al were
heading that way, and took Mary Hope by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time little girls like you went home,&#8221; he
said smiling, and somehow got her to the door
without having her trampled upon. &#8220;Where are
your wraps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Mary Hope dazedly, and pointed
to the corner behind them, where cloaks, hoods,
hats and two sleeping children were piled indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Through the doorway men were crowding, two
or three being pushed out only to be pushed in
again by others eager to join the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. In the
rear of the room, near the musicians, two men
were fighting. Lance, giving one glance to the
fight and another to the struggling mass in the
doorway, pushed up the window nearest them,
lifted Mary Hope and put her out on the side hill.
He felt of a coat or two, chose the heaviest, found
something soft and furry like a cap, and followed
her. Behind the door no one seemed to look.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
A solid mass of backs was turned toward him when
he wriggled through on his stomach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your horse?&#8221; he asked Mary Hope,
while he slipped the coat on her and buttoned it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem to me that a Lorrigan is <i>always</i>
making me put on a coat!&#8221; cried Mary Hope petulantly.
&#8220;And now, this isn&#8217;t mine at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A non-essential detail. It&#8217;s a coat, and that&#8217;s
all that matters. Where is your horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any horse here&ndash;&ndash;oh, they&#8217;re killing
each other in there! The Kennedys brought me&ndash;&ndash;and
he&#8217;s that drunk, now&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heck! Bill Kennedy! Well, come on.
You couldn&#8217;t go back with them, that&#8217;s sure. I&#8217;ll
take you home, girl.&#8221; He was leading her by the
arm to the fence behind the house. &#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ll
lift a wire; can you crawl under?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ve torn it! I heard it rip. And it
isn&#8217;t my coat at all,&#8221; said Mary Hope. &#8220;Oh,
they&#8217;re murdering one another! I should think
you&#8217;d be ashamed, having a dance like&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coats can be bought&ndash;&ndash;and murdered men
don&#8217;t swear like that. I&#8217;ll have to borrow Belle&#8217;s
pintos, but we don&#8217;t care, do we? Come on. Here
they are. Don&#8217;t get in until I get them untied and
turned around. And when I say get in, you&#8217;d
better make it in one jump. Are you game?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No Lorrigan will ever cry shame on a Douglas
for a coward! You must be crazy, taking this
awful team.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am. I&#8217;m crazy to get you away from here
before they start shooting, back there.&#8221; He spoke
to the team gruffly and with a tone of authority
that held them quiet, wondering at his audacity
perhaps. He untied them, got the lines, stepped
in and turned them around, the pintos backing
and cramping the buckboard, lunging a little but
too surprised to misbehave in their usual form.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get in&ndash;&ndash;and hang on. There&#8217;s no road much&ndash;&ndash;but
we&#8217;ll make it, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like the pintos, Mary Hope was too astonished
to rebel. She got in.</p>
<p>The team went plunging up the hill, snorting
now and then, swerving sharply away from rock
or bush that threatened them with vague horrors
in the clear starlight. Behind them surged the
clamor of many voices shouting, the confused
scuffling of feet, a revolver shot or two, and threading
the whole the shrill, upbraiding voice of a
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Mrs. Miller,&#8221; Mary Hope volunteered
jerkily. &#8220;She&#8217;s the one that was scalded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t her tongue that was hurt,&#8221; Lance
observed, and barely saved the buckboard from upsetting
on a rock as Rosa and Subrosa shied violently
and simultaneously at a rabbit scuttling
from a bush before them.</p>
<p>He swung the pintos to the right, jounced down
into some sort of trail, and let them go loping
along at their usual pace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Belle has her own ideas about horse-training,&#8221;
Lance chuckled, steadying Subrosa with a twitch
of the rein. &#8220;They&#8217;ll hit this gait all the way to
your ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope gave a gasp and caught him by the
arm, shaking it a little as if she were afraid that
otherwise he would not listen to her. &#8220;Oh, but I
canna go home! I&#8217;ve a horse and my riding
clothes in Jumpoff, and I must go for them and
come home properly on horseback to-morrow!
It&#8217;s because of the lie I told my mother, so that I
could come to the dance with the Kennedys. Set
me down here anywhere, Lance Lorrigan, and let
me walk until the Kennedys overtake me! They&#8217;ll
be coming soon, now&ndash;&ndash;as soon as Bill Kennedy
gets licket sober. You can stop the horses&ndash;&ndash;surely
you can stop them and let me out. But
please, <i>please</i> do not take me home to-night, in
this party dress&ndash;&ndash;and a coat that isna mine at
all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not taking you home, girl. I&#8217;m taking
you to Jumpoff. And it won&#8217;t matter to you
whether Bill Kennedy is licked sober or not. And
to-morrow I&#8217;ll find out who owns the coat. I&#8217;ll say
I found it on the road somewhere. Who&#8217;s to prove
I didn&#8217;t? Or if you disapprove of lying about it,
I&#8217;ll bring it back and leave it beside the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of trouble I&#8217;m making for you,&#8221; said
Mary Hope quite meekly, and let go his arm. &#8220;I
should not have told the lie and gone to the dance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
And I canna wear my own coat home, because it&#8217;s
there in the pile behind the door, and some one
else will take it. So after all it will be known that
I lied, and you may as well take me home now and
let me face it.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this Lance made no reply. But when the
pintos came rattling down the hill to where the
Douglas trail led away to the right, he did not
slow them, did not take the turn.</p>
<p>Mary Hope looked anxiously toward home, away
beyond the broken skyline. A star hung big and
bright on the point of a certain hill that marked
the Douglas ranch. While she watched it, the star
slid out of sight as if it were going down to warn
Hugh Douglas that his daughter had told a lie and
had gone to a forbidden place to dance with forbidden
people, and was even now driving through
the night with one of the Lorrigans,&ndash;&ndash;perchance
the wickedest of all the wicked Lorrigans, because
he had been away beyond the Rim and had learned
the wickedness of the cities.</p>
<p>She looked wistfully at the face of this wickedest
of the Lorrigans, his profile seen dimly in the
starlight. He did not look wicked. Under his
hat brim she could see his brows, heavy and
straight and lifted whimsically at the inner points,
as though he were thinking of something amusing.
His nose was fine and straight, too,&ndash;&ndash;not at all
like a beak, though her father had always maintained
that the Lorrigans were but human vultures.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
His mouth,&ndash;&ndash;there was something in the look of
his mouth that made her catch her breath; something
tender, something that vaguely disturbed
her, made her feel that it could be terribly stern
if it were not so tender. He seemed to be smiling&ndash;&ndash;not
with his mouth, exactly, but away inside of
his mind&ndash;&ndash;and the smile showed just a little bit,
at the corner of his lips. His chin was the Lorrigan
chin absolutely; a nice chin to look at, with
a little, long dimple down the middle. A chin
that one would not want to oppose, would not want
to see when the man who owned it was very angry.</p>
<p>Mary Hope had gone just so far in her analysis
when Lance turned his head abruptly, unexpectedly,
and looked full into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, girl. Don&#8217;t worry about the
lie&ndash;&ndash;about anything. It was a sweet little lie&ndash;&ndash;it
makes you just human and young and&ndash;&ndash;sweet.
Let them scold you, and smile, &#8217;way down deep in
your heart, and be glad you&#8217;re human enough to
tell a lie now and then. Because if you hadn&#8217;t,
we wouldn&#8217;t be driving all these miles together to
save you a little of the scolding. Be happy. Be
just a little bit happy to-night, won&#8217;t you, girl&ndash;&ndash;you
lonely little girl&ndash;&ndash;with the blue, blue eyes!&#8221;</p>
<p>There it was again, that vibrant, caressing note
in his voice. It was there in his eyes while he
looked at her, on his lips while he spoke to her.
But the next moment he looked ahead at the trail,
spoke to Rosa who had flung her head around to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
bite pettishly at Subrosa, who snapped back at
her.</p>
<p>Mary Hope turned her face to the starlit rangeland.
Again she breathed quickly, fought back
tears, fought the feeling that she had been kissed.
All through the silent ride that followed she fought
the feeling, knew that it was foolish, that Lance
knew nothing whatever about that look, that tone
which so affected her. He did not speak again.
He sat beside her, and she felt that he was thinking
about her, felt that his heart was making love
to her&ndash;&ndash;hated herself fiercely for the feeling,
fought it and felt it just the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a way he has with him!&#8221; she told herself
bitterly, when he swung the team up in front
of the section house and helped her down. &#8220;He&#8217;d
have the same way with him if he spoke to a&ndash;&ndash;a
rabbit! He doesna mean it&ndash;&ndash;he doesna know and
he doesna care!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Lorrigan. It was very kind
of you to bring me.&#8221; Her voice was prim and
very Scotch, and gave no hint of all she had been
thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always kind&ndash;&ndash;to myself,&#8221; laughed Lance,
and lifted his hat and drove away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH LANCE FINISHES ONE JOB</h3>
</div>
<p>In the Traffic saloon, whither Lance had gone to
find a fire and an easy chair and something
cheering to drink while he waited for the pinto
team to rest and eat, he found a sleepy bartender
sprawled before the stove, a black-and-white
dog stretched flat on its side and growling
while it dreamed, and an all-pervading odor of
alcoholic beverages that appealed to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A highball would make me happy, right now,&#8221;
he announced cheerfully, standing over the bartender,
rubbing his fingers numbed from the keen
air and from holding in the pintos, to which a
slackened pull on the bits meant a tacit consent
to a headlong run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been to the dance?&#8221; The bartender yawned
widely and went to mix the highball. &#8220;I been
kinda waitin&#8217; up&ndash;&ndash;but shucks! No tellin&#8217; when
the crowd&#8217;ll git in&ndash;&ndash;not if they drink all they took
with &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were working hard to do just that when
I left.&#8221; Lance stood back to the stove. Having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
left in a hurry, without his overcoat, he was
chilled to the bone, though the night had been mild
for that time of the year. He hoped that the girl
had not been uncomfortable&ndash;&ndash;and yawned while
the thought held him. He drank his highball,
warmed himself comfortably and then, with some
one&#8217;s fur overcoat for a blanket, he disposed his
big body on a near-by pool table, never dreaming
that Mary Hope Douglas was remembering his
tone, his words, his silence even; analyzing, weighing,
wondering how much he had meant, or how
little,&ndash;&ndash;wondering whether she really hated him,
whether she might justly call her ponderings by
any name save curiosity. Such is the way of
women the world over.</p>
<p>What Lance thought does not greatly matter.
Such is the way of men that their thoughts sooner
or later crystallize into action. The bartender
would tell you that he went straight to sleep, with
the fur coat pulled up over his ears and his legs uncovered,
his modishly-shod feet extending beyond
the end of the table. The bartender dozed in his
chair, thinking it not worth while to close up, because
the dance crowd might come straying in at
any time with much noise and a great thirst, to say
nothing of the possibility of thirsty men coming on
the midnight freight that was always four or five
hours late, and was now much overdue.</p>
<p>The freight arrived. Three men entered the
saloon, drank whisky, talked for a few minutes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
departed. The bartender took a long, heat-warped
poker and attacked the red clinkers in the
body of the stove, threw in a bucket of fresh coal,
used the poker with good effect on the choked
draft beneath, and went back to his chair and his
dozing.</p>
<p>During the clamor of the fire-building Lance
turned over, drawing up his feet and straightway
extending them again; making a sleepy, futile
clutch at the fur coat, that had slipped off his
shoulders when he turned. The bartender reached
out and flung the coat up on Lance&#8217;s shoulders, and
bit off a chew of tobacco and stowed it away in his
cheek. Presently he dozed again.</p>
<p>Dawn seeped in through the windows. Lance,
lying flat on his stomach with his face on his folded
arms, slept soundly. The unpainted buildings
across the street became visible in the gloomy, lifeless
gray of a sunless morning. With the breeze
that swept a flurry of gray dust and a torn newspaper
down the street, came the rattle of a wagon,
the sound of voices mingled in raucous, incoherent
wrangling.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re comin&#8217;,&#8221; yawned the bartender, glancing
at the sleeper on the pool table. &#8220;Better wake
up; they&#8217;re comin&#8217; pickled and fighty, judgin&#8217; by
the sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance sighed, turned his face away from the
light and slept on, untroubled by the nearing tumult.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>Galloping horses came first, <i>ka-lup, ka-lup, ka-lup</i>,
a sharp staccato on the frosted earth. The
rattle of the wagon ceased, resumed, stopped outside
the saloon. Other galloping horsemen came
up and stopped. The door was flung open violently,
letting in men with unfinished sentences
hot on their tongues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time a Lorrigan dance comes off&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;d a done, woulda&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fix them damn Lorrigans!&#8221;</p>
<p>Detached phrases, no one man troubling to find
a listener, the words came jumbled to the ears of
Lance, who fancied himself in the bunk-house at
home, with the boys just in from a ride somewhere.
He was wriggling into a freshly uncomfortable
posture on the table when the fur coat was pulled
off him, letting the daylight suddenly into his eyes
as his brain emerged from the fog of sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s the&ndash;&ndash;guy that run away from
me!&#8221; Bill Kennedy jerked off his hat and
brought it down with a slap on Lance&#8217;s face.
&#8220;Run off to town, by jiminy, and hid! Run&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Half asleep as he was&ndash;&ndash;rather, just shocked
awake&ndash;&ndash;Lance heaved himself off the table and
landed one square blow on Bill Kennedy&#8217;s purple
jaw. Bill staggered, caught himself and came
back, arms up and fists guarding his face. Lance
disentangled his feet from the fur coat, kicked it
out of his way and struck again just as Kennedy
was slugging at him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>At the bar the long line of men whirled, glasses
in hand, to watch the fight. But it did not last
long. Kennedy was drunk, and Lance was not.
So presently Kennedy was crawling on his knees
amongst some overturned chairs, and Lance was
facing the crowd, every inch of him itching to fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it said he was going to fix them damn
Lorrigans?&#8221; he demanded, coming at them warily.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not packing a gun, but I&#8217;d like to lick a few
of you fellows that tried to rough-house the dance
I gave. Didn&#8217;t cost you a cent; music, supper,
everything furnished for you folks to have a good
time&ndash;&ndash;and the way you had it was to wreck the
place like the rotten-souled hoodlums you are.
Now, who is it wants to fix the damn Lorrigans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, for one; what yuh go&#8217;n take my girl away
from me for?&#8221; a flushed youth cried, and flung
the dregs of his whisky glass at Lance. There was
not more than a half teaspoon in the glass, but the
intent was plain enough.</p>
<p>Lance walked up and knocked that young man
staggering half across the room, slapped with the
flat of his hand another who leered at him, whirled
to meet some one who struck him a glancing blow
on the ear, and flung him after the first.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all of you drunk&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s a one-sided fight
all the way through,&#8221; he cried, parrying a blow
from Kennedy, who had gotten to his feet and
came at him again mouthing obscenity. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
lick you, if you insist.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>His coat had hampered him until it obligingly
slit up the back. He wriggled out of the two
halves, tore off his cuffs, and went after the crowd
with his bare fists. Some one lifted a chair
threateningly, and Lance seized it and sent it
crashing through a window. Some one else threw
a beer mug, but he ducked in time and broke a
knuckle on the front teeth of the thrower. He saw
a gap in the teeth, saw the man edge out of the fray
spitting blood while he made for the door, and felt
that the blow was worth a broken knuckle.</p>
<p>It was not a pretty fight. Such fights never are
pretty. Lance himself was not a pretty sight,
when he had finished. There had been shooting&ndash;&ndash;but
even in Jumpoff one hesitated to shoot down
an unarmed man, so that the bar fixtures suffered
most. Lance came out of it with a fragment of
shirt hanging down his chest like a baby&#8217;s bib,
a cut lip that bled all over his chin, a cheek skinned
and swelling rapidly, the bad knuckle and the full
flavor of victory.</p>
<p>The saloon looked as though cattle had been
driven through it. Bill Kennedy lay sprawled
over a card table, whimpering inarticulately because
he had lost his gun at the dance. The
flushed youth who had rashly claimed Mary Hope
as his girl was outside with a washbasin trying to
stop his nose from bleeding. Others were ministering
to their hurts as best they might, muttering
the thoughts that they dared not express aloud.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>Lance looked up from examination of his
knuckle, caressed his cut lip with the tip of his
tongue, pulled the fragment of shirt down as far
as possible, gently rubbed his swelling cheek, and
turned to the bartender.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never licked a man yet and sent him home
thirsty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Set it out for the boys&ndash;&ndash;and
give me another highball. Then if you&#8217;ll lend me
a coat and a pair of gloves, I&#8217;ll go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peace was ratified in whisky drunk solemnly.
Lance paid, and turned to go. One of the vanquished
wabbled up to him and held out his hand
to shake.</p>
<p>&#8220;You damn Lorrigans, you got us comin&#8217; and
goin&#8217;,&#8221; he complained, &#8220;but shake, anyway. I&#8217;m
Irish meself, and I know a rale fight when I see it.
What we didn&#8217;t git at the dance before we left, by
heavins you give us when we got into town&ndash;&ndash;so
I&#8217;m one that&#8217;s game to say it was a fine dance and
not a dull momint anywhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something,&#8221; Lance grinned wryly and
wriggled into the fur overcoat which the bartender
generously lent him. He rejected the gloves when
he found that his hands were puffed and painful,
and went out to find breakfast.</p>
<p>Over a thick white cup of dubious coffee and a
plate of sticky hot-cakes he meditated glumly on
the general unappreciativeness of the world in
general, and of the Black Rim in particular.
What had happened at the schoolhouse he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
only surmise, but from certain fragmentary remarks
he had overheard he guessed that the schoolhouse
probably had suffered as much as the saloon.
Black Rim, it would seem, was determined that the
Lorrigans should go on living up to their reputations,
however peacefully inclined the Lorrigans
might be.</p>
<p>Two disquieting thoughts he took with him to
the stable when he went after the pinto team:
Mary Hope would say that it was not a pleasant
surprise which he had given her at Cottonwood
Spring. And Belle,&ndash;&ndash;he was not at all sure
whether he was too big for Belle&#8217;s quirt to find the
tender places on his legs, but he was very sure
that the Irishman spoke the truth. There would
still be no dull moments for Lance when he confronted
the owner of that pinto team.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>
<h3>HE TACKLES ANOTHER</h3>
</div>
<p>Much to the disgust of Rosa and Subrosa,
their new driver turned them from the main
trail just as they were beginning to climb joyously
the first grade of Devil&#8217;s Tooth Ridge. Rosa and
Subrosa were subdued, plainly resentful of their
subjection, and fretting to be in their own stalls.
Belle they could and did bully to a certain extent.
They loved to fight things out with Belle, they
never missed an opportunity for &#8220;acting up&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;yet
this morning they had been afraid to do more
than nag at each other with bared teeth; afraid to
lope when this big man said, &#8220;Hey&ndash;&ndash;settle down,
there!&#8221; with a grating kind of calm that carried
with it a new and unknown menace.</p>
<p>Some one had exuberantly fired the Whipple
shack, and the pintos wanted to whirl short around
in their tracks when they saw the smoking embers.
They had wanted to bolt straight out across the
rocky upland and splinter the doubletree, and perhaps
smash a wheel or two, and then stand and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
kick gleefully at the wreck. If head-shakings and
flattened ears meant anything, Rosa and Subrosa
were two disgruntled pintos that morning. They
had not dared do more than cut a small half-circle
out of the trail when they passed the blackened
spot that had been the Whipple shack.</p>
<p>Now they turned down the rocky, half-formed
trail to Cottonwood Spring, reluctantly but with
no more than a half-hearted kick from Subrosa
to register their disgust. And to that Lance gave
no heed whatever. He did not so much as twitch
a rein or yell a threat. He drove surely&ndash;&ndash;with
one hand mostly because of the broken knuckle,
which was painful in the extreme&ndash;&ndash;ignoring the
pintos for the most part.</p>
<p>He was meditating rather gloomily upon the innate
cussedness of human nature as it was developed
in Black Rim Country. He was thinking
of Mary Hope&ndash;&ndash;a little; of her eyes, that were so
obstinately blue, so antagonistically blue, and then,
quite unexpectedly, so wistfully blue; of her voice,
that dropped quite as unexpectedly into pure Scottish
melody; of her primness, that sometimes was
not prim at all, but quaintly humorous, or wistfully
shy.</p>
<p>He was thinking more often of the dance that
had started out so well and had ended&ndash;&ndash;Lord
knew how, except that it ended in a fight. He remembered
striking, in that saloon, faces that had
been pummeled before ever he sent a jab their way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
There had been eyes already closed behind purple,
puffy curtains of bruised flesh. He had fought
animosity that was none of his creating.</p>
<p>Thinking of the fight, he thought of the wrecked
saloon when the fight was over. Thinking of the
wrecked saloon led him to think of the probable
condition of the nice new schoolhouse. Thinking
of that brought him back to Mary Hope,&ndash;&ndash;to her
face as it looked when she rode up to the place on
Monday morning. Ride up to it she must, if she
meant to go on teaching, for there was no more
Whipple shack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rotten bunch of rough-necks,&#8221; he summed up
the men of Black Rim and of Jumpoff. &#8220;And
they&#8217;ll blame the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;ll
say the Lorrigans did it. Oh, well&ndash;&ndash;heck!&#8221;</p>
<p>So he drove down into the hollow, tied the pintos
to the post where they stood the night before,
crawled through the wire fence where Mary Hope
had left a small three-cornered fragment of the
coat that &#8220;wasna&#8221; hers at all, and went over to the
schoolhouse, standing forlorn in the trampled yard
with broken sandwiches and bits of orange peel
and empty whisky flasks accentuating the unsightliness
and disorder.</p>
<p>The door swung half open. The floor was
scored, grimy with dirt tracked in on heedless feet
and ground into the wax that had been liberally
scattered over it to make the boards smooth for
dancing. A window was broken,&ndash;&ndash;by some one&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
elbow or by a pistol shot, Lance guessed. The
planks placed along the wall on boxes to form seats
were pulled askew, the stovepipe had been knocked
down and lay disjointed and battered in a corner.
It was not, in Lance&#8217;s opinion, a pleasant little
surprise for the girl with the Scotch blue eyes.</p>
<p>He pulled the door shut, picked up the empty
whisky flasks and threw them, one after the other,
as far as he could send them into a rocky gulch
where Mary Hope would not be likely to go. Then
he recrossed the enclosure, crawled through the
fence, untied the pintos and drove home.</p>
<p>The bunk house emanated a pronounced odor of
whisky and bad air, and much snoring, just as
Lance expected. The horses dozed in the corral
or tossed listlessly their trampled hay; the house
was quiet, deserted looking, with the doors all
closed and the blinds down in the windows of the
room that had been the birthplace of Belle&#8217;s three
boys.</p>
<p>Lance knew that every one would be asleep to-day.
The Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch had always slept
through the day after a dance, with certain yawning
intermissions at mealtimes.</p>
<p>He unhitched the pintos, turned them loose in
the corral, caught his own horse, which one of the
boys must have led home, and tied it to a post.
From the chuck-wagon, standing just where Riley
had driven it to a vacant spot beside the woodpile,
Lance purloined a can of pork and beans, a loaf of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
bread, and some butter. These things he put in a
bag.</p>
<p>For a minute he stood scowling at the silent
house, undecided, wondering just how soundly
Belle was sleeping. He was not afraid of Belle;
no real Lorrigan was ever afraid of anything, as
fear is usually defined. But he wanted to postpone
for a time her reckoning with him. He
wanted to face her when he had a free mind, when
she had slept well, when her temper was not so
edgy. He wanted other things, however, and he
proceeded to get those things with the least effort
and delay.</p>
<p>He wanted soft cloths. On the clothesline dangled
three undershirts, three pair of drawers and
several mismated socks. The shirts and drawers
were of the kind known as fleece-lined&ndash;&ndash;which
means that they are fuzzy on the inside. They were
Riley&#8217;s complete wardrobe so far as underwear
went, but Lance did not trouble himself with unimportant
details. He took them all, because he had
a swift mental picture of the schoolhouse floor
which would need much scrubbing before it would
be clean.</p>
<p>He was ready to mount and ride away when he
remembered something else that he would need.
&#8220;Lye!&#8221; he muttered, and retraced his steps to
the house. Now he must go into the kitchen shed
for what he wanted, and Riley slept in a little
room next the shed. But Riley was snoring with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
a perfect rhythm that bespoke a body sunk deep
in slumber, so Lance searched until he found what
he wanted, and added a full box of a much-advertised
washing powder for good measure. He was
fairly well burdened when he finally started up the
trail again, but he believed that he had everything
that he would need, even a lump of putty, and a
pane of glass which he had carefully removed from
a window of the chicken house, and which he hoped
would fit.</p>
<p>You may think that he rode gladly upon his errand;
that the thought of Mary Hope turned the
work before him into a labor of love. It did not.
Lance Lorrigan was the glummest young man in
the whole Black Rim, and there was much glumness
amongst the Rim folk that day, let me tell you.
He ached from fighting, from dancing, from sleeping
on the pool table, from hanging for hours to
those darned pintos. His left hand was swollen,
and pains from the knuckle streaked like hot
wires to his elbow and beyond. His lips were sore&ndash;&ndash;so
sore he could not even swear with any comfort&ndash;&ndash;and
even the pulling together of his black
eyebrows hurt his puffed cheek. And he never
had scrubbed a floor in his life, and knew that he
was going to hate the work even worse than he
hated the men who had made the scrubbing necessary.</p>
<p>While he went up the Slide trail he wished that
he had never thought of giving a dance. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
wished he had gone down to Los Angeles for his
Easter holiday, as one of his pals had implored
him to do. He wished Mary Hope would quit
teaching school; what did she want to stay in the
Black Rim for, anyway? Why didn&#8217;t she get out
where she could amount to something?</p>
<p>If there were any caressing cadences in the voice
of Lance Lorrigan, any provocative tilt to his eyebrows,
any tenderness in his smile, anything enigmatical
in his personality, none of these things
were apparent when he set the first bucket of water
on the stove to heat. He had added to his charms
a broad streak of soot across his forehead and a
scratch on his neck, acquired while putting up the
stovepipe. He had set his lip to bleeding because
he forgot that it was cut, and drew it sharply between
his teeth when the stovepipe fell apart just
when he was sure it was up to stay. He had invented
two new cuss-words. What he had not
done was weaken in his determination to make that
small schoolhouse a pleasant surprise for Mary
Hope.</p>
<p>He did the work thoroughly, though a woman
might have pointed out wet corners and certain
muddy splashes on the wall. He lost all count of
the buckets of water that he carried from the
spring, and it occurred to him that Mary Hope
would need a new broom, for the one Belle had provided
was worn down to a one-sided wisp that reminded
him of the beard of a billy goat. He used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
two cans of condensed lye and all of the washing
powder, and sneezed himself too weak too swear
over the fine cloud of acrid dust that filled his nostrils
when he sprinkled the powder on the floor.
But the floor was clean when he finished, and so
was the platform outside.</p>
<p>Of Riley&#8217;s underwear there was left the leg of
one pair of drawers, which Lance reserved for
dusting the desks and the globe that had by some
miracle escaped. While the floor was drying he
took out the broken windowpane, discovered that
the one from the chicken house was too short, and
cut his thumb while he chipped off a piece of glass
from the other to fill the space. He did not make
a very good job of it. To hold the glass in place,
he used shingle nails, which he had to hunt for on
the ground where they had dropped from the roof
during shingling, and when they had been driven
into the frame&ndash;&ndash;with the handle of the screwdriver&ndash;&ndash;they
showed very plainly from the inside.
Then the putty did not seem to want to
stick anywhere, but kept crumbling off in little
lumps. So Lance threw the putty at a gopher
that was standing up nibbling one of Riley&#8217;s sandwiches,
and went after the desks.</p>
<p>These took some time to unwrap and carry into
place. There were only twelve, but Lance would
have sworn before a jury that he carried at least
fifty single desks into the schoolhouse that afternoon,
and screwed them to the floor, and unscrewed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
them because the darned things did not line up
straight when viewed from the teacher&#8217;s desk,
and he had a vivid impression that blue, blue eyes
can be very critical over such things as a crooked
line of desks!</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because his head ached splittingly
and his injured hand throbbed until it was
practically useless; at any rate the cleaning of the
schoolhouse, especially the placing of the desks,
became fixed afterward in his memory as the biggest,
the most disagreeable incident in his whole
vacation.</p>
<p>At four-thirty however the task was accomplished.
At the spring, Lance scrubbed the water
bucket clean, washed the dipper, placed them behind
the door. He got wearily into the borrowed
fur coat, took a last comprehensive survey of the
room from the doorway, went back to erase certain
sentences scrawled on the blackboard by some
would-be humorist, took another look at the work
of his aching hands, and went away with the coffeepot
in his hand and the screwdriver showing its
battered wooden handle from the top of his pocket.
He was too tired to feel any glow of accomplishment,
any great joy in the thought of Mary Hope&#8217;s
pleasure. He was not even sure that she would
feel any pleasure.</p>
<p>His chief emotion was a gloomy satisfaction in
knowing that the place was once more presentable,
that it was ready for Mary Hope to hang up her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
hat and ring her little bell and start right in teaching.
That what the Lorrigans had set out to do,
the Lorrigans had done.</p>
<p>At the ranch he found Riley at the bunk house
wrangling with the boys over his lost wardrobe.
In Riley&#8217;s opinion it was a darned poor idea of a
darned poor joke, and it took a darned poor man
to perpetrate it. Lance&#8217;s arrival scarcely interrupted
the jangle of voices. The boys had bruises
of their own to nurse, and they had scant sympathy
for Riley, and they told him so.</p>
<p>Lance went into the house. He supposed he would
have to replace Riley&#8217;s clothes, which he did, very
matter-of-factly and without any comment whatever,
restitution being in this case a mere matter
of sorting out three suits of his own underwear,
which were much better than Riley&#8217;s, and placing
them on the cook&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Lance? Where in the world have
you been all this while? I came mighty near going
gunning after the man that stole my team, let me
tell you&ndash;&ndash;and I would have, if Tom hadn&#8217;t found
your horse tied up to the fence and guessed you&#8217;d
gone to take Mary Hope home. But I must say,
honey, you never followed any short cut!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was much easier than Lance had expected,
so he made shift to laugh, though it hurt his lip
cruelly. &#8220;Had to take her to Jumpoff, Belle.
Then I had to clean up that crowd of toughs
that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You cleaned up Tom&#8217;s leavin&#8217;s, then!&#8221; Belle
made grim comment through Lance&#8217;s closed door.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think there was enough left of &#8217;em to
lick, by the time our boys got through. Haven&#8217;t
you been to bed yet, for heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to bed,&#8221; mumbled Lance, &#8220;when
I&#8217;ve had a bath and a meal. And to-morrow, Belle,
I think I&#8217;ll hit the trail for &#8217;Frisco. Hope you
don&#8217;t mind if I leave a few days early. I&#8217;ve got
to stop off anyway to see a fellow in Reno I promised&ndash;&ndash;any
hot water handy?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a perceptible pause before Belle answered,
and then it was not about the bath water.
She would not have been Belle Lorrigan if she
had permitted a quiver in her voice, yet it made
Lance thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honey, I don&#8217;t blame you for going. I expect
we are awful rough&ndash;&ndash;and you&#8217;d notice it,
coming from civilized folks. But&ndash;&ndash;you know,
don&#8217;t you, that the Lorrigans never spoiled your
party for you? It&ndash;&ndash;it just happened that the
Jumpoff crowd brought whisky out from town.
We <i>tried</i> to make it pleasant&ndash;&ndash;and it won&#8217;t happen
again&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your heart!&#8221; Clad with superb simplicity
in a bathrobe, Lance appeared unexpectedly
and gathered her into his arms. &#8220;If you think
I&#8217;m getting so darn civilized I can&#8217;t stay at home,
take a look at me! By heck, Belle, I&#8217;ll bet there
isn&#8217;t a man in the whole Black Rim that got as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
much fun out of that scrap as I did! But I&#8217;ve got
to <i>go</i>.&#8221; He patted her reassuringly on the head,
laid his good cheek against hers for a minute and
turned abruptly away into his own room. He
closed the door and stood absent-mindedly feeling
his swollen hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go,&#8221; he repeated
under his breath. &#8220;I might get foolish if I stayed.
Darned if I&#8217;ll make a fool of myself over any
girl!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>
<h3>ABOUT A PIANO</h3>
</div>
<p>In the lazy hour just after a satisfying dinner,
Lance stood leaning over an end of the piano,
watching Belle while she played&ndash;&ndash;he listened and
smoked a cigarette and looked as though he hadn&#8217;t
a thing on his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember you used to sing that a lot for the
little Douglas girl,&#8221; he observed idly. &#8220;She used
to sit and look at you&ndash;&ndash;my word, but her eyes
were the bluest, the lonesomest eyes I ever saw!
She seemed to think you were next to angels when
you sang. I saw it in her face, but I was too much
of a kid then to know what it was.&#8221; He lighted
a fresh cigarette, placed it between Belle&#8217;s lips
so that she need not stop playing while she smoked,
and laughed as if he were remembering something
funny.</p>
<p>&#8220;She always looked so horrified when she saw
you smoking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so adoring when
you sang, and so lonesome when she had to ride
away. She was a queer kid&ndash;&ndash;and she&#8217;s just as
unexpected now&ndash;&ndash;just as Scotch. Didn&#8217;t you
find her that way, dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was Scotch enough,&#8221; Tom mumbled from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
his chair by the fire. &#8220;Humpin&#8217; hyenas! She
was like handlin&#8217; a wildcat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor kid never did have a chance to be
human,&#8221; said Belle, and ceased playing for a moment.
&#8220;Good heavens, how she did enjoy the two
hours I gave her at the piano! She&#8217;s got the
makings of a musician, if she could keep at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We-ell&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Having artfully led Belle to this
point, Lance quite as artfully edged away from it.
&#8220;You gave her all the chance you could. And she
ought to be able to go on, if she wants to. I suppose
old Scotty&#8217;s human enough to get her something
to play on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him? <i>Human!</i>&#8221; Tom shifted in his chair.
&#8220;If pianos could breed and increase into a herd,
and he could ship a carload every fall, Scotty might
spend a few dollars on one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a darned shame,&#8221; Belle exclaimed, dropping
her fingers to the keys again. &#8220;Mary Hope
just <i>starves</i> for everything that makes life worth
living. And that old devil&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t make me feel like a great, overgrown
money-hog,&#8221; Lance protested. &#8220;A girl
starving for music, because she hasn&#8217;t a piano to
play on. And a piano costs, say, three or four
hundred dollars. Of course, we&#8217;ve got the money
to buy one&ndash;&ndash;I suppose I could dig up the price
myself. I was thinking I&#8217;d stake our schoolhouse
to a library. That&#8217;s something it really needs.
But a piano&ndash;&ndash;I wish you hadn&#8217;t said anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
about starving. I know I&#8217;d hate to go hungry for
music, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, humpin&#8217; hyenas! I&#8217;ll buy the girl a
piano. I guess it won&#8217;t break the outfit to pay out
a few more dollars, now we&#8217;ve started. We&#8217;re
outlaws, anyway&ndash;&ndash;might as well add one more
crime to the list. Only, it don&#8217;t go to the Douglas
shack&ndash;&ndash;it goes into the schoolhouse. Lance, you
go ahead and pick out some books and ship &#8217;em
on to the ranch, and I&#8217;ll see they get over there.
Long as we&#8217;ve started fixin&#8217; up a school, we may
as well finish the job up right. By Henry, I&#8217;ll
show the Black Rim that there ain&#8217;t anything small
about the Lorrigans, anyway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad, I think you&#8217;re showin&#8217; yourself a real
sport,&#8221; Lance laughed. &#8220;We-ell, if you&#8217;re game
to buy a piano, I&#8217;m game to buy books. We staked
Black Rim to a school, so we&#8217;ll do the job right.
And by the way, Belle, if you&#8217;re going to get me to
Jumpoff in time for that evening train, don&#8217;t you
think it&#8217;s about time you started?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is how it happened that Mary Hope walked
into the schoolhouse one Monday and found a very
shiny new piano standing across one corner of the
room where the light was best. On the top was
a pile of music. In another corner of the room
stood a bookcase and fifty volumes; she counted
them in her prim, frugal way that she had learned
from her mother. They were books evidently
approved by some Board of Education for school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
libraries, and did not interest her very much. Not
when a piano stood in the other corner.</p>
<p>She was early, so she opened it and ran her
fingers over the keys. She knew well enough who
had brought it there, and her mouth was pressed
into a straight line, her eyes were troubled.</p>
<p>The Lorrigans&ndash;&ndash;always the Lorrigans! Why
did they do these things when no one expected
goodness or generosity from them? Why
had they built the schoolhouse&ndash;&ndash;and then given a
dance where every one got drunk and the whole
thing ended in a fight? Every one said it was the
Lorrigans who had brought the whisky. Some one
told her they had a five-gallon keg of it in the shed
behind the schoolhouse, and she thought it must be
true, the way all the men had acted. And why had
they burned the Whipple shack and all the school
books, so that she could not have school until more
books were bought?&ndash;&ndash;an expense which the
Swedes, at least, could ill afford.</p>
<p>Why had Lance taken her to Jumpoff, away from
the fighting, and then gone straight to the saloon
and gotten so drunk that he fought every one in
town before he left in the morning? Why had he
never come near her again? And now that he was
back in California, why did he ignore her completely,
and never send so much as a picture postal
to show that he gave her a thought now and then?</p>
<p>Mary Hope would not play the piano that day.
She was more stern than usual with her pupils,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
and would not so much as answer them when they
asked her where the piano and all the books had
come from. Which was a foolish thing to do, since
the four Boyle children were keen enough to guess,
and sure to carry the news home, and to embellish
the truth in true range-gossip style.</p>
<p>Mary Hope fully decided that she would have
the piano hauled back to the Lorrigans. Later,
she was distressed because she could think of no
one who would take the time or the trouble to perform
the duty, and a piano she had to admit is
not a thing you can tie behind the cantle of your
saddle, or carry under your arm. The books were
a different matter. They were for the school.
But the piano&ndash;&ndash;well, the piano was for Mary
Hope Douglas, and Mary Hope Douglas did not
mean to be patronized in this manner by Lance
Lorrigan or any of his kin.</p>
<p>But she was a music-hungry little soul, and that
night after she was sure that the children had ridden
up over the basin&#8217;s brim and were out of hearing,
Mary Hope sat down and began to play.
When she began to play she began to cry, though
she was hardly conscious of her tears. She
seemed to hear Lance Lorrigan again, saying,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be lonely, you girl. Take the little pleasant
things that come&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She wondered, in a
whispery, heart-achey way, if he had meant the
piano when he said that. If he had meant&ndash;&ndash;just
a piano, and a lot of books for school!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>The next thing that she realized was that the
light was growing dim, and that her throat was
aching, and that she was playing over and over a
lovesong that had the refrain:</p>
<p class='center'>&#8220;Come back to me, sweetheart, and love me as before&ndash;&ndash;<br />
Come back to me, sweetheart, and leave me nevermore!&#8221;</p>
<p>Which was perfectly imbecile, a song she had always
hated because of its sickly sentimentality.
She had no sweetheart, and having none, she certainly
did not want him back. But she admitted
that there was a certain melodious swing to the
tune, and that her fingers had probably strayed
into the rhythm of it while she was thinking of
something totally different.</p>
<p>The next day she played a little at noontime for
the children, and when school was over she played
for two hours. And the next day after that
slipped away&ndash;&ndash;she really had meant to ride over to
the AJ, or send a note by the children, asking Jim
Boyle if he could please remove the piano and saying
that she felt it was too expensive a gift for
the school to accept from the Lorrigans.</p>
<p>On the third day she really did send a prim little
note to Jim Boyle, and she received a laconic reply,
wholly characteristic of the Black Rim&#8217;s attitude
toward the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Take all you can git and git all you can without going
to jale. That&#8217;s what the Lorrigans are doing, Yrs truly,</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;J. A. Boyle.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>It was useless to ask her father. She had known
that all along. When Alexander Douglas slipped
the collars up on the necks of his horses, he must
see where money would be gained from the labor.
And there was no money for the Douglas pocket
in hauling a piano down the Devil&#8217;s Tooth Ridge.</p>
<p>But the whole Black Rim was talking about it.
Mary Hope felt sure that they were saying ill-natured
things behind her back. Never did she
meet man or woman but the piano was mentioned.
Sometimes she was asked, with meaning smiles,
how she had come to stand in so well with the
Devil&#8217;s Tooth. She knew that they were all gossiping
of how Lance Lorrigan had taken her home
from the dance, with Belle Lorrigan&#8217;s bronco team.
She had been obliged to return a torn coat to
Mrs. Miller, and to receive her own and a long
lecture on the wisdom of choosing one&#8217;s company
with some care. She had been obliged to beg Mrs.
Miller not to mention the matter to her parents,
and the word had gone round, and had reached
Mother Douglas&ndash;&ndash;and you can imagine how pleasant
that made home for Mary Hope.</p>
<p>Because she was lonely, and no one seemed willing
to take it away, she kept the piano. She
played it, and while she played she wept because
the Rim folk simply would not understand how
little she wanted the Lorrigans to do things for
her. And then, one day, she hit upon a plan of
redeeming herself, for regaining the self-respect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
she felt was slipping from her with every day that
the piano stood in the schoolhouse.</p>
<p>She would give a series of dances&ndash;&ndash;they would
be orderly, well-behaved dances, with no refreshments
stronger than coffee and lemonade!&ndash;&ndash;and
she would sell tickets, and invite every one she
knew, and beg them to come and help to pay for the
school piano.</p>
<p>Even her mother approved that plan, though she
did not approve dances. &#8220;But the folk are that
sinfu&#8217; they canna bide wi&#8217; any pleasure save the
hoppin&#8217; aboot wi&#8217; their arms around the waist
of a woman,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;A church social wad
be far more tae my liking, Hope&ndash;&ndash;if we had only
a church!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since there isn&#8217;t any church, and people
won&#8217;t go to anything but a dance, I shall have to
get the money with dances,&#8221; Mary Hope replied
with some asperity. The subject was beginning
to wear her nerves. &#8220;Pay for it I shall, if it takes
all my teacher&#8217;s salary for five years! I wish the
Lorrigans had minded their own business. I&#8217;ve
heard nothing but piano ever since it came there.
I hate the Lorrigans! Sometimes I almost hate
the piano.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye shud hae thought on all that before ye accepit
a ride home wi&#8217; young Lance, wi&#8217; a coat ye
didna own on your back, and disobedience in your
heart. &#8217;Tis the worst of them a&#8217; ye chose to escort
ye, Hope, and if he thought he could safely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
presume to gi&#8217; ye a present like yon piano, ye hae
but yersel&#8217; tae blame for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t give it!&#8221; cried Mary Hope, her eyes
ablaze with resentment. &#8220;He wasna here when it
came. I havena heard from him and I dinna want
to hear from him. It was Belle Lorrigan gave the
piano, as I&#8217;ve said a million times. And I shall
pay for it&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not from your ain pocket will ye pay. Ye can
give the dance&ndash;&ndash;and if ye make it the Fourth of
July, with a picnic in the grove, and a dance in the
schoolhouse afterwards, &#8217;tis possible Jeanie may
come up from Pocatello wi&#8217; friends&ndash;&ndash;and twa
dollars wad no be too much to ask for a day and a
night of entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mother! When you do&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Mary
Hope bit her tongue upon the remainder of the
sentence. She had very nearly told her mother
that when she did choose to be human she had a
great head for business.</p>
<p>It was a fine, practical idea, and Mary Hope went
energetically about its development. She consulted
Mrs. Kennedy. Mrs. Kennedy also had
friends in Pocatello, and she obligingly gave the
names of them all. She strongly advised written
invitations, with a ticket enclosed and the price
marked plainly. She said it was a crying shame
the way the Lorrigans had conducted their dance,
and that Mary Hope ought to be very careful and
not include any of that rough bunch in this dance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Look how that young devil, Lance Lorrigan,
abused my Bill, right before everybody!&#8221; she
cited, shifting her youngest child, who was teething,
to her hip that she might gesticulate more
freely. &#8220;And look how they all piled into our
crowd and beat &#8217;em up! Great way to do&ndash;&ndash;give
a dance and then beat up the folks that come to
it! And look at what Lance done right here in
town&ndash;&ndash;as if it wasn&#8217;t enough, what they done out
there! Bill&#8217;s got a crick in his back yet, where
Lance knocked him over the edge of a card table.
You pay &#8217;em for the piano, Hope; I&#8217;ll help yuh
scare up a crowd. But don&#8217;t you have none of the
Lorrigans, or there&#8217;ll be trouble sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope flushed. &#8220;I could hardly ask the
Lorrigans to come and help pay for their own
present,&#8221; she pointed out in her prim tone. &#8220;I
had never intended to ask the Lorrigans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe not. But if you did ask them, I
know lots of folks that wouldn&#8217;t go a step&ndash;&ndash;and
my Bill&#8217;s one,&#8221; said Mrs. Kennedy.</p>
<p>So much depends upon one&#8217;s point of view.
Black Rim gossip, which persisted in linking Mary
Hope&#8217;s name with Lance Lorrigan, grinned among
themselves while they mentioned the piano, the
schoolhouse, and the library as evidence of Lance&#8217;s
being &#8220;stuck on her.&#8221; The Boyle children had
frequently tattled to Mary Hope what they heard
at home. Lance had done it all because he was
in love with her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>Denial did not mend matters, even if Mary
Hope&#8217;s pride had not rebelled against protesting
that the gossip was not true. Lance Lorrigan was
not in love with her. Over and over she told herself
so, fiercely and with much attention to evidence
which she considered convincing. Only twice she
had seen him in the two weeks of his visit. Once
he had come to mend the lock his father had broken,
and he had taken her home from the dance because
of the fighting. Never had he made love to her....
Here she would draw a long breath and
wonder a little, and afterwards shake her head and
say to herself that he thought no more of her than
of Jennie Miller. He&ndash;&ndash;he just had a way with
him.</p>
<p>Mary Hope&#8217;s point of view was, I think, justifiable.
Leaving out the intolerable implication
that Lance had showered benefits upon her, she felt
that the Lorrigans had been over-generous. The
schoolhouse and the books might be accepted as a
public-spirited effort to do their part. But the
piano, since it had not been returned, must be paid
for. And it seemed to Mary Hope that the Lorrigans
themselves would deeply resent being invited
to a dance openly given for the purpose of raising
money to repay them. It would never do; she
could not ask them to come.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the Lorrigans came there would be
trouble, whether there was whisky or not. At the
house-warming dance the Lorrigans had practically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
cleaned out the crowd and sent them home
long before daylight. There had been no serious
shooting&ndash;&ndash;the Lorrigans had fought with their
fists and had somehow held the crowd back from
the danger-line of gun-play. But Mary Hope
feared there would be a killing the next time that
the Jumpoff crowd and the Lorrigans came together.</p>
<p>She tried to be just, but she had heard only one
side of the affair,&ndash;&ndash;which was not the Lorrigan
side. Whispers had long been going round among
the Black Rim folk; sinister whispers that had to
do with cattle and horses that had disappeared
mysteriously from the Rim range. Mary Hope
could not help hearing the whispers, could not help
wondering if underneath them there was a basis of
truth. Her father still believed, in spite of Tom&#8217;s
exoneration, that his spotty yearling had gone
down the gullets of Devil&#8217;s Tooth men. She did
not know, but it seemed to her that where every one
hinted at the same thing, there must be some truth
in their hints.</p>
<p>All of which proves, I think, that Mary Hope&#8217;s
point of view was the only one that she could logically
hold, living as she did in the camp of the enemy;
having, as she had, a delicate sense of propriety,
and wanting above all things to do nothing
crude and common. As she saw it, she simply
could <i>not</i> ask any of the Lorrigans to her picnic
and dance on the Fourth of July.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h2>
<h3>THE LORRIGAN VIEWPOINT</h3>
</div>
<p>I have said that much depends upon one&#8217;s point
of view. Mary Hope&#8217;s viewpoint was not
shared by the Devil&#8217;s Tooth. They had one of
their own, and to them it seemed perfectly logical,
absolutely justifiable.</p>
<p>They heard all about the Fourth of July picnic
and dance, to be held at Cottonwood Spring and in
the schoolhouse of their own building. Immediately
they remembered that Cottonwood Spring
was on Lorrigan land, that Lorrigan money had
paid for the material that went into the schoolhouse,
that Lorrigan labor had built it, Lorrigan
generosity had given it over to the public as represented
by Mary Hope Douglas and the children
who came to her to be taught. In their minds
loomed the fact that Lorrigan money had bought
books for the school, and that Tom Lorrigan himself
had paid close to four hundred dollars for the
piano.</p>
<p>They heard that invitations were being sent
broadcast, that a crowd was coming from Pocatello,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
from Lava, from Jumpoff&ndash;&ndash;invited to come
and spend a day and night in merry-making. Yet
no invitation came to the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch, not
a word was said to them by Mary Hope, not a hint
that they were expected, or would be welcome.</p>
<p>Belle met Mary Hope in the trail one day, just
a week before the Fourth. Mary Hope was riding
home from school; Belle was driving out from
Jumpoff. It is the custom of the outland places
for acquaintances to stop for a bit of friendly conversation
when they meet, since meetings are so
far between. But, though Belle slowed the pintos
to a walk, Mary Hope only nodded, said, &#8220;How
do you do,&#8221; and rode on.</p>
<p>&#8220;She looked guilty,&#8221; Belle reported wrathfully
to Tom and the boys at the supper table. &#8220;Guilty
as sin. She seemed to be afraid I was going to
ask her if I couldn&#8217;t come to her dance. The little
fool! Does she think for a minute I&#8217;d <i>go?</i> She
hasn&#8217;t so much as thanked you for that piano, Tom.
She hasn&#8217;t said one word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t put my name and <i>ad</i>-dress on
it,&#8221; Tom palliated the ingratitude while he buttered
a hot biscuit generously. &#8220;And there
wasn&#8217;t any name on the books to show who bought
&#8217;em. Maybe she thinks&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what she thinks! It&#8217;s the way she
acts that counts. Everybody in Jumpoff has got
invitations to her picnic and dance. They say it&#8217;s
to pay us for the piano&ndash;&ndash;and they think she&#8217;s doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
some wonderful stunt. And we&#8217;re left out in
the cold!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never was in where it was right warm,
since I can remember,&#8221; said Al. &#8220;Except when
we made it warm ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam Pretty Cow was saying yesterday&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
and Duke repeated a bit of gossip that had a gibe at
the Lorrigans for its point. &#8220;He got it over to
Hitchcocks. It come from the Douglases. I guess
Mary Hope don&#8217;t want nothing of us&ndash;&ndash;except
what she can get out of us. We been a good thing,
all right&ndash;&ndash;easy marks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duke had done the least for her and therefore
felt qualified to say the most. His last sentence
did its work. Tom pulled his eyebrows together,
drew his lip between his teeth and leaned back in
his chair, thinking deeply, his eyes glittering between
his half-closed lids.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy marks, ay?&#8221; he snorted. &#8220;The Lorrigans
have been called plenty of things, fur back
as I can remember, but by the humpin&#8217; hyenas,
they never was called easy marks before!&#8221;</p>
<p>That was Tom&#8217;s last comment on the subject.
Belle, not liking the look on his face, because she
knew quite well what it portended, passed him two
kinds of preserves and changed the subject. Al
and Duke presently left for the bunk house. Mary
Hope&#8217;s party and her evident intention to slight
the Lorrigans was not mentioned again for days.</p>
<p>But Tom&#8217;s wrath was smoldering. He was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
hasty. He waited. He himself met Mary Hope
in the trail one day, lifted his hat to her without a
word and rode on. Mary Hope let him go with a
chilly nod and a murmured greeting which was no
more than an empty form. Certainly she did not
read Tom&#8217;s mind, did not dream that he was thinking
of the piano,&ndash;&ndash;and from an angle that had
never once presented itself to her.</p>
<p>So, now that you see how both were justified in
their opinions, as formed from different points of
view, let me tell you what happened.</p>
<p>Mary Hope had her picnic, with never a thunderstorm
to mar the day. Which is unusual, since
a picnic nearly always gets itself rained upon.
She had sent out more than a hundred invitations&ndash;&ndash;tickets
two dollars, please&ndash;&ndash;and there were
more who invited themselves and had to be supplied
with tickets cut hastily out of pasteboard
boxes that had held sandwiches.</p>
<p>Mary Hope was jubilant. Mother Douglas, as
official hostess, moved here and there among the
women who fussed over the baskets and placated
with broken pieces of cake their persistent offspring.
Mother Douglas actually smiled, though
her face plainly showed that it was quite unaccustomed
to the expression, and tilted the smile downward
at the corners. Mother Douglas was a good
woman, but she had had little in her life to bring
smiles, and her habitual expression was one of
mournful endurance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>It was sultry, and toward evening the mosquitoes
swarmed out of the lush grass around the
spring and set the horses stamping and moving
about uneasily. But it was a very successful picnic,
with all the chatter, all the gourmandizing, all
the gossip, all the childish romping in starched
white frocks, all the innocuous pastimes that one
expects to find at picnics.</p>
<p>Mary Hope wondered how in the world they
were all going to find room inside the schoolhouse
to dance. She had been frugal in the matter of
music, dreading to spend any money in hiring professional
musicians, lest she might not have enough
people to justify the expense. Now she wished
nervously that she had done as Lance Lorrigan had
done, and brought musicians from Lava. Of
course, there had been no piano when Lance gave
his party, which was different. She herself meant
to play, and Art Miller had brought his fiddle, and
Jennie had volunteered to &#8220;chord&#8221; with him.
But, Mary Hope felt much nervous apprehension
lest these Pocatello and Lava people should think
it was just Scotch stinginess on her part.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon a few of the ranchers rode
hastily homeward to &#8220;do the chores,&#8221; but the Lava
and Pocatello crowd remained, and began to drift
up to the schoolhouse and drum on the piano that
was actually going to pay for itself and free Mary
Hope&#8217;s pride from its burden.</p>
<p>By sundown a dozen energetic couples were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
waltzing while a Pocatello dentist with a stiff,
sandy pompadour chewed gum and played loudly,
with much arm movement and very little rhythm;
so very little rhythm that the shuffling feet frequently
ceased shuffling, and expostulations rose
high above his thunderous chords.</p>
<p>By dusk the overworked ranch women had fed
the last hungry mouth and put away the fragments
of home-baked cakes and thick sandwiches, and
were forming a solid line of light shirtwaists and
dark skirts along the wall. The dance was really
beginning.</p>
<p>As before, groups of men stood around outside
and smoked and slapped at mosquitoes&ndash;&ndash;except
that at Lance&#8217;s party there had been no mosquitoes
to slap&ndash;&ndash;and talked in undertones the gossip of
the ranges. If now and then the name of Lorrigan
was mentioned, there was no Lorrigan present to
hear. At intervals the &#8220;floor manager&#8221; would
come to the door and call out numbers: &#8220;Number
one, and up to and including sixteen, git your pardners
fer a two-step!&#8221; Whereupon certain men
would pinch out the glow of their cigarettes and
grind the stubs into the sod under their heels, and
go in to find partners. With that crowd, not all
could dance at once; Mary Hope remembered
pridefully that there had been no dancing by numbers
at the party Lance Lorrigan gave.</p>
<p>What a terrible dance that had been! A regular
rowdy affair. And this crowd, big as it was,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
had as yet shown no disposition to rowdyism. It
surely did make a difference, thought Mary Hope,
what kind of people sponsored an entertainment.
With the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit as the leaders, who
could expect anything but trouble?</p>
<p>Then she caught herself thinking, with a vague
heaviness in her heart, how Lance had taken her
away from that other dance; of that long, wonderful,
silent ride through the starlight; how careful
he had been of her&ndash;&ndash;how tender! But it was only
the way he had with him, she later reminded herself
impatiently, and smiled over her shoulder at
the whirling couples who danced to the music she
made; and thought of the money that made her
purse heavy as lead, the money that would wipe
out her debt to the Lorrigans,&ndash;&ndash;to Lance, if it
really were Lance who had bought the piano.</p>
<p>A faint sound came to her through the open
window, the rattle of a wagon coming down the hill
in the dark. More people were coming to the
dance, which meant more money to give to the Lorrigans.
Mary Hope smiled again and played
faster; so fast that more than one young man
shook his head at her as he circled past, and puffed
ostentatiously, laughing at the pace she set. She
had a wild vision of other dances which she would
give&ndash;&ndash;Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New
Year&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;and pay the Lorrigans for everything
they had done; for the books, for the schoolhouse,
everything. She felt that then, and then only,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
could she face Lance Lorrigan level-eyed, cool,
calm, feeling herself a match for him.</p>
<p>The rattle of the wagon sounded nearer, circled
the yard, came in at the gate. Mary Hope was giving
the dancers the fastest two-step she could play,
and she laughed aloud. More people were coming
to the dance, and there might not be coffee and
sandwiches enough at midnight,&ndash;&ndash;she had over
three hundred dollars already.</p>
<p>The dancers whirled past, parted to right and
left, stopped all at once. Mary Hope, still playing,
looked over her shoulder&ndash;&ndash;into the dark,
impenetrable gaze of Tom Lorrigan, standing
there in his working clothes, with his big, black
Stetson on his head and his six-shooter in its holster
on his hip. Behind him Mary Hope saw Al
and Duke and Belle, and behind them other Devil&#8217;s
Tooth men, cowboys whom she only knew slightly
from meeting them sometimes in the trail as she
rode to and from school. The cowboys seemed to
be facing the other way, holding back the crowd
near the door.</p>
<p>Mary Hope looked again into Tom&#8217;s face, looked
at Belle. Her fingers strayed uncertainly over the
keys, making discords. She half rose, then sat
down again. The room, all at once, seemed very
still.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to disturb yuh,&#8221; Tom said, touching
his hat brim and lifting his eyebrows at her, half
smiling with his lips pulled to one side, like Lance&ndash;&ndash;oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
maddeningly like Lance!&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;but I&#8217;ve come
after the piano.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope gasped. Her arms went out instinctively
across the keyboard, as if she would
protect the instrument from his defaming touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask yuh to move,&#8221; said Tom.
&#8220;Sorry to disturb yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m going to pay for it,&#8221; said Mary Hope,
finding her voice faint and husky. She had an odd
sensation that this was a nightmare. She had
dreamed so often of the dance and of the Lorrigans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I paid for it long ago. I bought the piano&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve
come after it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope slid off the stool, stood facing him,
her eyes very blue. After all, he was not Lance.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t have it!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let you
take it. I&#8217;m raising money to pay you for it, and
I intend to keep it.&#8221; She reached for her purse,
but Tom restrained her with a gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t for sale,&#8221; he said, with that hateful
smile that always made her wonder just what lay
behind it. &#8220;I own it, and I ain&#8217;t thinking of selling.
Here&#8217;s the shipping bill and the guarantee and all;
I brought &#8217;em along to show you, in case you got
curious about whose piano it is. You see the
number on the bill&ndash;&ndash;86945. You&#8217;ll find it tallies
with the number in the case, if you want to look.
Pete, Ed, John, take it and load it in the wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, see here! This is an outrage!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
How much is the darn thing worth, anyway? This
crowd is not going to stand by and see a raw deal
like this pulled off.&#8221; It was the Pocatello dentist,
and he was very much excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw a raw deal, and stood for it, when you
saw the Lorrigans cold-shouldered out of the
dance,&#8221; Belle flashed at him. &#8220;We&#8217;ve stood for a
lot, but this went a little beyond our limit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to stand for anything like
this, you know!&#8221; Another man&ndash;&ndash;also from Lava&ndash;&ndash;shouldered
his way up to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git outa the way, or you&#8217;ll git tromped on!&#8221;
cried Pete over his shoulder as he backed, embracing
the piano and groping for handholds.</p>
<p>The Lava man gripped Pete, trying to pull him
away. Pete kicked back viciously with a spurred
heel. The Lava man yelled and retreated, limping.</p>
<p>Just how it happened, no two men or women
afterward agreed in the telling. But somehow
the merrymakers, who were merry no longer, went
back and back until they were packed solidly at
the sides and near the door, a few squeezing
through it when they were lucky enough to find
room. Behind them came four of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
men with six-shooters, looking the crowd coldly
in the eyes. Behind these came the piano, propelled
by those whom Tom had named with the
tone of authority.</p>
<p>The crowd squeezed closer against the wall as
the piano went past them. There was not so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
noise and confusion as one would expect. Then,
at the last, slim, overworked, round-shouldered
Mother Douglas, who had done little save pray and
weep and work and scold all her life, walked up and
slapped Belle full on the cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye painted Jezebel!&#8221; she cried, her eyes burning.
&#8220;Long have I wanted to smack ye for your
wickedness and the brazen ways of ye&ndash;&ndash;ye painted
Jezebel!&#8221;</p>
<p>Blind, dazed with anger, Belle struck back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you touch my mother! Shame on you!
Shame on you all! I didna ask you for your favors,
for any gifts&ndash;&ndash;and you gave them and then
you come and take them&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; This was the voice of
Mary Hope, shrill with rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gave a dance in a house built for you by
the Lorrigans, on Lorrigan land, and you danced
to the music of a Lorrigan piano&ndash;&ndash;and the Lorrigans
were not good enough to be asked to come!
Get outa my way, Hope Douglas&ndash;&ndash;and take your
mother with you. Call <i>me</i> a painted Jezebel, will
she?&#8221;</p>
<p>The piano was outside, being loaded into the
wagon, where Riley sat on the seat, chewing tobacco
grimly and expectorating copiously, without
regard for those who came close. Outside there
was also much clamor of voices. A lantern held
high by a Devil&#8217;s Tooth man who had a gun
in the other, lighted the platform and the wagon
beside it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>At the last, Tom Lorrigan himself went back
after the stool, and the room silenced so that his
footsteps sounded loud on the empty floor. He
looked at Mary Hope, looked at her mother, looked
at the huddled, whispering women, the gaping
children. He swung out of his course and slipped
one arm around Belle and so led her outside, the
stool swinging by one leg in the other hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;A painted Jezebel!&#8221; Belle said under her
breath when they were outside the ring of light.
&#8220;My God, Tom, think of that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope had never in her life suffered such
humiliation. It seemed to her that she stood disgraced
before the whole world, that there was no
spot wherein she might hide her shame. Her
mother was weeping hysterically because she had
been &#8220;slappit by the painted Jezebel&#8221; and because
Aleck was not there to avenge her. The Pocatello
and Lava crowd seemed on the point of leaving,
and were talking very fast in undertones that made
Mary Hope feel that they were talking about her.
The rattle of the Lorrigan wagon hauling the piano
away, the click of the horses&#8217; feet as the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth riders convoyed the instrument, made her
wince, and want to put her palms over her ears
to shut out the sound of it.</p>
<p>But she was Scotch, and a Douglas. There was
no weak fiber that would let her slump before this
emergency. She went back to the little platform,
stood beside the desk that held the globe and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
dictionary and a can of flowers, and rapped loudly
with the ruler from the Pocatello hardware store.
By degrees the room ceased buzzing with excited
talk, the shuffling feet stood still.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry,&#8221; said Mary Hope clearly,
&#8220;that your pleasure has&ndash;&ndash;has been interrupted.
It seems there has been a misunderstanding about
the piano. I thought that I could buy it for the
school, and for that reason I gave this dance. But
it seems&ndash;&ndash;that&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m terribly sorry the dance has
been spoiled for you, and if the gentlemen who
bought tickets will please step this way, I will return
your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had to clench her teeth to keep her lips from
trembling. Her hands shook so that she could
scarcely open her handbag. But her purpose
never faltered, her eyes were blue and sparkling
when she looked out over the crowd. She waited.
Feet scuffled the bare floor, voices whispered, but
no man came toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to return your money,&#8221; she said
sharply, &#8220;because without the piano I suppose you
will not want to dance, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, the dickens!&#8221; cried a big, good-natured
cowpuncher with a sun-peeled nose and twinkly
gray eyes. &#8220;I guess we all have danced plenty
without no piano music. There&#8217;s mouth harps in
this crowd, and there&#8217;s a fiddle. Git yore pardners
for a square dance!&#8221; And under his breath,
to his immediate masculine neighbors he added:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
&#8220;To hell with the Lorrigans and their piano!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope could have hugged that cowpuncher
who hastily seized her hand and swung her into
place as the first couple in the first set.</p>
<p>When the three sets were formed he called the
dance figures in a sonorous tone that swept out
through the open windows and reached the ears
of the Lorrigans as they rode away.</p>
<p class='center'>&#8220;<i>Honor</i> yore pardner&ndash;&ndash;and the lady on your <i>left!</i><br />
<i>Join</i> eight hands, an&#8217; a-circle to the <i>left!</i><br />
Break an <i>Indian</i> trail home in the Indian <i>style</i>, with the<br />
       lady in the <i>lead!</i><br />
Swing the lady <i>behind</i> you once in a while!&ndash;&ndash;<br />
The lady <i>behind</i> you once in a while!&ndash;&ndash;<br />
<i>Now</i> your pardner, and go hog <i>wild!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The fiddle and two mouth harps were scarcely
heard above the rhythmic stamping of feet, the
loud chant of the caller, who swung Mary Hope
clear of the floor whenever he put his arm around
her.</p>
<p class='center'>&#8220;A&ndash;&ndash;<i>second</i> couple out, and a-cir-cle <i>four!</i><br />
    <i>Lay</i>-dees do ce <i>do!</i><br />
<i>You</i> swing me, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll swing <i>you</i>&ndash;&ndash;<br />
And <i>we&#8217;ll</i> all dance in the same ole <i>shoe!</i><br />
<br />
&#8220;<i>Same</i> four on to the <i>next!</i>&ndash;&ndash;dance the ocean <i>wave!</i><br />
The <i>same</i> ole boys, the <i>same</i> ole trail,<br />
<i>Watch</i> that possum walk the <i>rail!</i><br />
<i>Cir</i>-cle six, and a-do ce <i>do!</i><br />
Swing, <i>every</i> one swing, and a&ndash;&ndash;promenade <i>home!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Who</i> wants a piano? Couldn&#8217;t hear it if yuh&#8217;
had it!&#8221; he cried, while the twelve couples paused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
breathless. Then he wiped his face frankly and
thoroughly with his handkerchief, caught Mary
Hope&#8217;s hand in his, lifted his voice again in his
contagious sing-song:</p>
<p class='center'>&#8220;<i>Cir</i>-cle eight, till you get straight!<br />
<i>Swing</i> them ladies, like swingin&#8217; on a <i>gate!</i><br />
<i>Left</i> foot up, and-a-right foot <i>down</i>&ndash;&ndash;<br />
<i>Make</i> that big foot jar the <i>ground!</i><br />
    Prom-e-<i>nade!</i><br />
<i>Swing</i> yore corner, if you ain&#8217;t too <i>slow!</i><br />
<i>Now</i> yore pardner, and around you <i>go!</i><br />
For the&ndash;&ndash;<i>last</i> time&ndash;&ndash;and a-<i>long</i> time&ndash;&ndash;<br />
<i>You</i> know where, and a-I don&#8217;t <i>care!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The dance was saved by the big cowpuncher with
the peeling nose and the twinkly gray eyes. Mary
Hope had never seen him before that day, but
whenever she looked at him a lump came in her
throat, a warm rush of sheer gratitude thrilled
her. She did not learn his name&ndash;&ndash;two or three
men called him Burt, but he seemed to be a
stranger in the country. Burt saved her dance
and kept things moving until the sky was streaked
with red and birds were twittering outside in the
cottonwoods.</p>
<p>She wanted to thank him, to tell him a little of
her gratitude. But when she went to look for
him afterwards he was gone, and no one seemed
to know just where he belonged. Which was
strange, when you consider that in the Black Rim
country every one knows everybody.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h2>
<h3>PEDDLED RUMORS</h3>
</div>
<p>In the smoking compartment of a Pullman car
that rocked westward from Pocatello two days
after the Fourth, Lance sprawled his big body on a
long seat, his head joggling against the dusty
window, his mind sleepily recalling, round by
round, a certain prize fight that had held him in
Reno over the Fourth and had cost him some
money and much disgust. The clicking of the car
trucks directly underneath, the whirring of the
electric fan over his head, the reek of tobacco
smoke seemed to him to last for hours, seemed
likely to go on forever. Above it all, rising stridently
now and then in a disagreeable monotone,
the harsh, faintly snarling voice of a man on the
opposite seat blended unpleasantly with his dozing
discomfort. For a long time the man had been
talking, and Lance had been aware of a grating
quality of the voice, that yet seemed humorous in
its utterances, since his two listeners laughed frequently
and made brief, profane comment that encouraged
the talker to go on. Finally, as he slowly
returned from the hazy borderland of slumber,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
Lance became indifferently aware of the man&#8217;s
words.</p>
<p>From under the peak of his plaid traveling cap
Lance lifted his eyelids the length of his black
lashes, measured the men with a half-minute survey
and closed his eyes again. The face matched
the voice. A harsh face, with bold blue eyes,
black eyebrows that met over his nose, a mouth
slightly prominent, hard and tilted downward at
the corners. Over the harshness like a veil was
spread a sardonic kind of humor that gave attraction
to the man&#8217;s personality. In the monotone of
his voice was threaded a certain dry wit that gave
point to his observations. He was an automobile
salesman, it appeared, and his headquarters were
in Ogden, and he was going through to Shoshone
on business connected with a delayed shipment of
cars. But he was talking, when Lance first awoke
to his monologue, of the sagebrush country
through which the fast mail was reeling drunkenly,
making up time that had been lost because of a
washout that had held the train for an hour while
two section crews sweated over a broken culvert.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;And by gosh! the funniest thing I ever saw
happened right up here in a stretch of country they
call the Black Rim. If I was a story writer, I
sure would write it up. Talk about the West being
tame!&ndash;&ndash;why, I can take you right now, within
a few hours&#8217; ride, to where men ride with guns on
&#8217;em just as much as they wear their pants. Only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
reason they ain&#8217;t all killed off, I reckon, is because
they <i>all</i> pack guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard-boiled? Say, there&#8217;s a bunch up there
that&#8217;s never been curried below the knees&ndash;&ndash;and
never will be. They pulled off a stunt the Fourth
that I&#8217;ll bet ain&#8217;t ever been duplicated anywhere
on earth, and never will be. I was in Pocatello,
and I went on up with the crowd from there, and
got in on the show. And sa-ay, it was some show!</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got a feud up there that&#8217;s rock-bottomed
as any feud you ever heard of in Kentucky.
It&#8217;s been going on for years, and it&#8217;ll keep going
on till the old folks all die off or move away&ndash;&ndash;or
land in the pen. Hasn&#8217;t been a killing in there for
years, but that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re all so damn tough
they know if one starts shooting it&#8217;ll spread like
a prairie fire through dry grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an outfit in there&ndash;&ndash;the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
outfit. Far back as the country was settled&ndash;&ndash;well,
they say the first Lorrigan went up in there
to get away from the draft in the Civil War, and
headed a gang of outlaws that shot and hung more
white men and Injuns than any outfit in the State&ndash;&ndash;and
that&#8217;s going some.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were killers from the first draw. Other
settlers went in, and had to knuckle under. The
Devil&#8217;s Tooth gang had the Black Rim in its fist.
Father to son&ndash;&ndash;they handed down the disposition&ndash;&ndash;I
could tell yuh from here to Boise yarns about
that outfit.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Now, of course, things have tamed down. As
I say, there hasn&#8217;t been a Devil&#8217;s Tooth killing for
years. But it&#8217;s there, you know&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s in the
blood. It&#8217;s all under the surface. They&#8217;re a
good-hearted bunch, but it&#8217;ll take about four generations
to live down the reputation they&#8217;ve got,
if they all turned Methodist preachers. And,&#8221; the
grating voice paused for a minute, so that one
caught the full significance of his hint, &#8220;if all yuh
hear is true, religion ain&#8217;t struck the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
yet. It ain&#8217;t my business to peddle rumors, and
the time&#8217;s past when you can hang a man on suspicion&ndash;&ndash;but
if you read about the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
outfit some time in the paper, remember I said it&#8217;s
brewing. The present Tom Lorrigan ain&#8217;t spending
<i>all</i> his time driving his cows to water. He was
hauled up a few years ago, on a charge of rustling.
An old Scotchman had him arrested. Tom was
cleared&ndash;&ndash;he had the best lawyer in the West&ndash;&ndash;brought
him from Boise, where they need good
lawyers!&ndash;&ndash;and got off clear. And since then he&#8217;s
been laying low. That&#8217;s the one mistake he&#8217;s
made, in my opinion. He never did a damn thing,
never tried to kill the Scotchman, never acted up
at all. And when you think of the breed of cats
he is you&#8217;ll see yourself that the Black Rim is
setting on a volcano.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Lorrigan has got more men working for
him than any outfit in that country. He runs his
own round-up and won&#8217;t have a rep&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
representative&ndash;&ndash;from any other outfit in his
camp. His own men haze outside stock off his
range. He&#8217;s getting rich. He ships more cattle,
more horses than anybody in the country. He
don&#8217;t have any truck with any of his neighbors,
and his men don&#8217;t. They&#8217;re outside men, mostly.
There ain&#8217;t a thing anybody can swear to&ndash;&ndash;there
ain&#8217;t a thing said out loud about the Devil&#8217;s Tooth.
But it&#8217;s hinted and it&#8217;s whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;So all this preamble prepares you for the funniest
thing I ever saw pulled. But I guess I&#8217;m
about the only one who saw how funny it was. I
know the Black Rim don&#8217;t seem to see the joke, and
I know the Devil&#8217;s Tooth don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it&#8217;s so big and neighbors are so far
apart that there ain&#8217;t any school district, and a
few kids were getting school age, and no place to
send &#8217;em. So a couple of families got together
and hired the daughter of this old Scotchman to
teach school. I ain&#8217;t calling her by name&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s
a nice kid, and a nervy kid, and I can see where she
thought she was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she taught in a tumble-down little shack
for a while, and one day this Tom Lorrigan come
along, and saw how the girl and the kids were sitting
there half froze, and he hazed &#8217;em all home.
Broke up the school. Being a Lorrigan, all he&#8217;d
have to do would be to tell &#8217;em to git&ndash;&ndash;but it made
a little stir, all right. The schoolma&#8217;am, she
went right back the next morning and started in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
again. Like shooing a setting hen off her nest,
it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, next thing they knew, the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
had built a schoolhouse and said nothing about it.
Tom&#8217;s a big-hearted cuss&ndash;&ndash;I know Tom&ndash;&ndash;tried
to sell him a car, last fall. Darn near made it
stick, too. I figured that Tom Lorrigan was
maybe ashamed of busting up the school and making
talk, so he put up a regular schoolhouse. Then
one of his boys had been away to college&ndash;&ndash;only
one of the outfit that ever went beyond the Rim,
as far as I know&ndash;&ndash;and he gave a dance; a regular
house-warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wasn&#8217;t at that dance. I wish I had
been. They packed in whisky by the barrel.
Everybody got drunk, and everybody got to fighting.
This young rooster from college licked a
dozen or so, and then took the schoolma&#8217;am and
drove clear to Jumpoff with her, and licked everybody
in town before he left. Sa-ay, it musta been
some dance, all right!</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&ndash;&ndash;here comes the funny part. Everybody
was all stirred up over the Lorrigans&#8217; dance,
and right in the middle of the powwow, blest if the
Lorrigans didn&#8217;t buy a brand new piano and haul
it to the schoolhouse. They say it was the college
youth, that was stuck on the schoolma&#8217;am. Well,
everybody out that way got to talking and gossiping&ndash;&ndash;you
know how it goes&ndash;&ndash;until the schoolma&#8217;am,
just to settle the talk, goes and gives a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
dance to raise money to pay for the piano. She&#8217;s
all right&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t think for a minute she&#8217;s anything
but <i>right</i>&ndash;&ndash;and it might have been old Tom
himself that bought the piano. Anyway, she went
and sent invitations all around, two dollars per
invite, and got a big crowd. Had a picnic in the
grove, and everything was lovely.</p>
<p>&#8220;But sa-ay! She forgot to invite the Lorrigans!
Everybody in the country there, except
the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit. I figure that she was
afraid they might rough things up a little&ndash;&ndash;and
maybe she didn&#8217;t like to ask them to pay for something
they&#8217;d already paid for&ndash;&ndash;but anyway, just
when the dance was going good, here came the
whole Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit with a four-horse team,
and I&#8217;m darned if they didn&#8217;t walk right in there,
in the middle of a dance, take the piano stool right
out from under the schoolma&#8217;am, and haul the
piano home! They&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A loud guffaw from his friends halted the narrative
there. Before the teller of the tale went on,
Lance pulled his cap down over his eyes, got up
and walked out and stood on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;They hauled the piano <i>home!</i>&#8221; He scowled
out at the reeling line of telegraph posts. &#8220;They&ndash;&ndash;hauled&ndash;&ndash;that
piano&ndash;&ndash;home!&#8221;</p>
<p>He lighted a cigar, took two puffs and threw the
thing out over the rail. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t ask the Lorrigans&ndash;&ndash;to
her party. And dad&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He whirled and went back into the smoking compartment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
He wanted to hear more. The seat
he had occupied was still empty and he settled into
it, his cap pulled over his eyes, a magazine before
his face. The others paid no attention. The
harsh-voiced man was still talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they can&#8217;t go on forever. They&#8217;re
bound to slip up, soon or late. And now, of course,
there&#8217;s a line-up against them. It&#8217;s in the blood
and I don&#8217;t reckon they can change&ndash;&ndash;but the country&#8217;s
changing. I know of one man that&#8217;s in there
now, working in the dark, trying to get the goods&ndash;&ndash;but
of course, it&#8217;s not my business to peddle
that kind of stuff. I was tickled about the piano,
though. The schoolma&#8217;am was game. She offered
to give us back our two dollars per, but of
course nobody was piker enough to take her up on
it. We went ahead and had the dance with harmonicas
and a fiddle, and made out all right.
Looks to me like the schoolma&#8217;am&#8217;s all to the good.
She&#8217;s got the dance money&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was of no use. Lance found he could not listen
to that man talking about Mary Hope. To
strike the man on his fish-like, hard-lipped mouth
would only make matters worse, so he once more
left the compartment and stood in the open doorway
of the vestibule just beyond. The train, slowing
to a stop at a tank station, jarred to a standstill.
In the compartment behind him the man&#8217;s
voice sounded loud and raucous now that the mechanical
noises had ceased.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never knew it to fail&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s in the
blood will come out. They&#8217;ve lived there for three
generations now. They&#8217;re killers, thieves at heart&ndash;&ndash;human
birds of prey, and it don&#8217;t matter if it
is all under the surface. I say it&#8217;s <i>there</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, Lance had the hunger to kill,
to stop forever the harsh voice that talked on and
on of the Lorrigans and their ingrained badness.
He stepped outside, slamming the door shut behind
him. The voice, fainter now, could still be
heard. He swung down to the cinders, stood there
staring ahead at the long train, counting the cars,
watching the fireman run with his oil can and climb
into the engine cab. He could no longer hear the
voice, but he felt that he must forget it or go back
and kill the man who owned it.</p>
<p>In the car ahead a little girl leaned out of the
window, her curls whipping across her face.
Jubilantly she waved her hand at him, shrilled a
sweet, &#8220;Hello-oh. Where <i>you</i> goin&#8217;? I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to my grandma&#8217;s house!&#8221;</p>
<p>The rigor left Lance&#8217;s jaw. He smiled, showing
his teeth, saw that a brakeman was down inspecting
a hot box on the forward truck of that car,
and walked along to the window where the little
girl leaned and waited, waving two sticky hands
at him to hurry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, baby. I know a grandma that&#8217;s going
to be mighty happy, before long,&#8221; he said, standing
just under the window and looking up at her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know my gran&#8217;ma? S&#8217;e lives in a green
house an&#8217; s&#8217;e&#8217;s got five&ndash;&ndash;hundred baby kittens for
me to see! An&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to bring one home wis
me&ndash;&ndash;but I <i>do&#8217;no</i> which one. D&#8217;you like yellow
kittens, or litty gray kittens, or black ones?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gravely Lance studied the matter, his eyebrows
pulled together, his mouth wearing the expression
which had disturbed Mary Hope when he came to
mend the lock on her door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take&ndash;&ndash;now, if your grandma has one that&#8217;s
all spotted, you might take that, couldn&#8217;t you?
Then some days you&#8217;d love the yellow spots, and
some days you&#8217;d love the black spots, and some
days&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooh! And I could call it <i>all</i> the nice names I
want to call it!&#8221; The little girl pressed her hands
together rapturously. &#8220;When my kitty&#8217;s got its
yellow-spotty day, I&#8217;ll call him Goldy, and
when&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The engine bell clanged warning, the wheels began
slowly to turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooh! You&#8217;ll get left and have to walk!&#8221; cried
the little girl, in big-eyed alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, baby&ndash;&ndash;you take the spotted one!&#8221;
Lance called over his shoulder as he ran. He was
smiling when he swung up the steps. No longer
did he feel that he must kill the harsh-voiced man.</p>
<p>He went forward to his own section, sat down
and stared out of the window. As the memory of
the little girl faded he drifted into gloomily reviewing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
the things he had heard said of his family.
Were they really pariahs among their kind? Outlawed
because of the blood that flowed in their
veins?</p>
<p>Away in the back of his mind, pushed there because
the thought was not pleasant, and because
thinking could not make it pleasant, had been the
knowledge that he was returning to a life with
which he no longer seemed to be quite in tune.
Two weeks had served to show him that he had
somehow drifted away from his father and Duke
and Al, that he had somehow come to look at life
differently. He did not believe in the harsh man&#8217;s
theory of their outlawry; yet he felt a reluctance
toward meeting again their silent measurement of
himself, their intangible aloofness.</p>
<p>The harsh-voiced man had dragged it all to the
surface, roughly sketching for the delectation of
his friends the very things which Lance had been
deliberately covering from his own eyes. He had
done more. He had told things that made Lance
wince. To humiliate Mary Hope before the whole
Black Rim, as they had done, to take away the
piano which he had wanted her to have&ndash;&ndash;for that
Lance could have throttled his dad. It was like
Tom to do it. Lance could not doubt that he had
done it. He could picture the whole wretchedly
cheap retaliation for the slight which Mary Hope
had given them, and the picture tormented him,
made him writhe mentally. But he could picture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
also Mary Hope&#8217;s prim disapproval of them all,
her deliberate omission of the Lorrigans from her
list of invited guests, and toward that picture he
felt a keen resentment.</p>
<p>The whole thing maddened him. The more, because
he was in a sense responsible for it all. Just
because he had not wanted that lonely look to cloud
the blue eyes of her, just because he had not wanted
her to be unhappy in her isolation, he had somehow
brought to the surface all those boorish qualities
which he had begun to hate in his family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheap&ndash;&ndash;cheap as dirt!&#8221; he gritted once, and
he included them all in the denunciation.</p>
<p>Furiously he wished that he had gone straight
home, had not stopped in Reno for the fight. But
on the heels of that he knew that he would have
made the trouble worse, had he been at the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth on the day of the Fourth. He would have
quarreled with Tom, but there was scant hope that
he could have prevented the piano-moving. Tom
Lorrigan, as Lance had plenty of memories to
testify, was not the man whom one could prevent
from doing what he set out to do.</p>
<p>At a little junction Lance changed to the branch
line, still dwelling fiercely upon his heritage, upon
the lawless environment in which that heritage of
violence had flourished. He was in the mood to
live up to the Lorrigan reputation when he swung
off the train at Jumpoff, but no man crossed his
trail.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>So Lance carried with him the full measure of
his rage against Mary Hope and the Devil&#8217;s Tooth,
when he rode out of Jumpoff on a lean-flanked
black horse that rolled a wicked eye back at the
rider and carried his head high, looking for trouble
along the trail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h2>
<h3>MARY HOPE HAS MUCH TROUBLE</h3>
</div>
<p>Mary Hope, still taking her own point of
view, had troubles in plenty to bear. In her
own way she was quite as furious as was Lance, felt
quite as injured as did the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit, had
all the humiliation of knowing that the Black Rim
talked of nothing but her quarrel with the Lorrigans,
and in addition had certain domestic worries
of her own.</p>
<p>Her mother harped continually on the piano
quarrel and the indignity of having been &#8220;slappit&#8221;
by the painted Jezebel. But that was not what
worried Mary Hope most, for she was long accustomed
to her mother&#8217;s habit of dwelling tearfully
on some particular wrong that had been done her.
Mary Hope was worried over her father.</p>
<p>On the day of the Fourth he had stayed at home,
tinkering up his machinery, making ready for
haying that was soon to occupy all his waking
hours,&ndash;&ndash;and they would be as many as daylight
would give him. He had been doing something to
an old mower that should have gone to the junk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
heap long ago, and with the rusty sickle he had
managed to cut his hand very deeply, just under
the ball of the thumb. He had not taken the
trouble to cleanse the cut thoroughly, but had
wrapped his handkerchief around the hand and
gone glumly on with his work. Now, on the third
day, Mary Hope had become frightened at the discoloration
of the wound and the way in which his
arm was swelling, and had begged him to let her
drive him to Jumpoff where he could take the
train to Lava and a doctor. As might be expected,
he had refused to do anything of the kind.
He would not spend the time, and he would not
spend the money, and he thought that a poultice
would draw out the swelling well enough. Mary
Hope had no faith in poultices, and she was on the
point of riding to Jumpoff and telegraphing for
a doctor when her father cannily read her mind
and forbade her so sternly that she quailed before
him.</p>
<p>There was another thing, which she must do.
She must take the money she had gotten from the
dance and with it pay Tom Lorrigan for the schoolhouse,
or stop the school altogether. Jim Boyle,
when she had ridden over to the AJ to tell him,
had said that she could do as she pleased about
paying for the schoolhouse; but if she refused to
teach his kids, he would get some one else who
would. Jim Boyle seemed to feel no compunctions
whatever about accepting favors from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Devil&#8217;s Tooth. As to Sederson, the Swede, he was
working for Boyle, and did what his boss said.
So the matter was flung back upon Mary Hope for
adjustment according to the dictates of her pride
or conscience, call it which you will.</p>
<p>Her mother advised her to keep the money and
buy another piano. But Mary Hope declared that
she would not use the schoolhouse while it was a
Lorrigan gift; whereupon Mother Douglas yielded
the point grudgingly and told her to send Hugh,
the gawky youth, to the Devil&#8217;s Tooth with the
three hundred dollars and a note saying what the
money was for. But her father would not permit
Hugh to go, reiterating feverishly that he needed
Hugh on the ranch. And with the pain racking
him and making his temper something fearful to
face, Mary Hope dared not argue with him.</p>
<p>So she herself set out with her money and her
hurt pride and all her troubles, to pay the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth outfit for the schoolhouse&ndash;&ndash;approximately,
since she had only a vague idea of the cost of the
building&ndash;&ndash;and then be quit of the Lorrigan patronage
forever.</p>
<p>It happened that she found Tom at home and
evidently in a temper not much milder than her
father&#8217;s. Two of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth men were at
the stable door when she rode up, and to them Tom
was talking in a voice that sent shivers over Mary
Hope when she heard it. Not loud and declamatory,
like her father&#8217;s, but with a certain implacable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
calm that was harder to face than stormy
vituperation.</p>
<p>But she faced it, now that she was there and Tom
had been warned of her coming by Coaley, who
pointed his ears forward inquiringly when she
neared the stable. The two cowpunchers gave
Tom slanting glances and left, muttering under
their breaths to each other as they led their sweaty
horses into a farther corral.</p>
<p>Tom lifted his hand to his hat brim in mute recognition
of her presence, gave her a swift inquiring
look and turned Coaley into the stable with the
saddle on. Mary Hope took one deep breath and,
fumbling at a heavy little bag tied beside the fork
of her saddle, plunged straight into her subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought the money I raised at the dance,
Mr. Lorrigan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Since you refused to
take it for the piano, I have brought it to pay you
for the schoolhouse&ndash;&ndash;with Mr. Boyle&#8217;s approval.
I have three hundred and twelve dollars. If that
is not enough, I will pay you the balance later.&#8221;
She felt secretly rather well satisfied with the
speech, which went even better than her rehearsals
of it on the way over.</p>
<p>Then, having untied the bag, she looked up, and
her satisfaction slumped abruptly into perturbation.
Tom was leaning back against the corral
rails, with his arms folded&ndash;&ndash;and just <i>why</i> must
he lift his eyebrows and smile like Lance? She
was going to hand him the bag, but her fingers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
bungled and she dropped it in the six-inch dust of
the trail.</p>
<p>Tom unfolded his arms, moved forward a pace,
picked up the bag and offered it to her. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got the buying fever, looks like to me,&#8221; he observed
coldly. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got any schoolhouse to
sell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have! You built it, and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did build a shack up on the hill, awhile back,&#8221;
Tom admitted in the same deliberate tone, &#8220;but I
turned it over to Jim Boyle and the Swede and
whoever else wanted to send their kids there to
school.&#8221; Since Mary Hope refused to put out her
hand for the bag, Tom began very calmly to retie
it on her saddle. But she struck his hand away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not take the money. I shall pay for
the schoolhouse, Mr. Lorrigan. Unless I can pay
for it I shall never teach school there another
day!&#8221; Her voice shook with nervous tension.
One did not lightly and unthinkingly measure wills
with Tom Lorrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your business, whether you teach school
or not,&#8221; said Tom, holding the bag as though he
still meant to tie it on the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I don&#8217;t they will hire another teacher,
and that will drive me away from home to earn
money&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Mary Hope had not in the least intended
to say that, which might be interpreted
as a bid for sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Belle, she says no strange woman can use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
that schoolhouse. They might not find anything
to teach school in, if they tried that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to keep that money.&#8221; Mary Hope
turned the Roman-nosed horse half away, meaning
to leave Tom there with the money in his hand.</p>
<p>Tom reached calmly out and caught the horse
by the bridle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tell you something,&#8221; he drawled, in
the voice which she had heard when she came up.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t <i>&#8216;got&#8217;</i> to do anything. But I tell you
what I <i>will</i> do. If you don&#8217;t take this money back
and go ahead with your school-teaching as if nothing
had happened, I&#8217;ll burn that schoolhouse to
the last chip in the yard. And this money I&#8217;ll take
and throw down that crevice under the Tooth,
up there. The money won&#8217;t do nobody any good,
and the schoolhouse won&#8217;t be nothing at all but a
black spot. You can suit yourself&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s up to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope looked at him, opened her lips to
defy him, and instead gave a small sob. Her
Scotch blood chilled at the threat of such wanton
destruction of property and money, but it was not
that which made her afraid at that moment of
Tom Lorrigan,&ndash;&ndash;held her silent, glaring impotently.</p>
<p>She trembled while he tied the money to the
saddle fork again, using a knot she had never seen
tied before. She wanted to tell him how much she
hated him, how much she hated the whole Lorrigan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
family, how she would die before she ever
entered the door of that schoolhouse again unless
it was paid for and she could be free of obligation
to him.</p>
<p>But when his head was bent, hiding all of his face
but the chin, she had a wild fleeting notion that he
was Lance, and that he would lift his head and
smile at her. Yet when he lifted his head he was
just Tom Lorrigan, with a hardness in his face
which Lance did not have, and a glint in his eye
that told her his will was inexorable, that he would
do exactly what he said he would do, and perhaps
more, if she opposed him.</p>
<p>Without a word she turned back, crushed under
the sense of defeat. Useless destruction of property
and money did not seem to mean anything at
all to a Lorrigan, but to her the thought was horrible.
She could not endure the thought of what
he would do if she refused to use the schoolhouse.
Much less could she endure the thought of entering
the place again while it remained a Lorrigan
gift.</p>
<p>Blindly fighting an hysterical impulse to cry
aloud like a child over her hurt, she reined Jamie
into the shortcut trail of the Slide. Coming down
she had followed the wagon road, partly because
the longer trail postponed a dreaded meeting, and
partly because Jamie, being uncertain in his temper
and inclined to panicky spells when things did
not go just right with him, could not safely be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
trusted on the Slide trail, which was strange to
him.</p>
<p>Until she reached the narrow place along the
shale side hill she did not realize what trail she
was taking. Then, because she could not leave the
trail and take the road without retracing her steps
almost to the stable, she went on, giving Jamie an
impatient kick with her heel and sending him snorting
over the treacherous stuff in a high canter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on and break your neck and mine too, if
ye like,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;Ye needn&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll give
an inch to <i>you;</i> it&#8217;s bad enough.&#8221; When Jamie,
still snorting, still reckless with his feet, somehow
managed to pass over the boulder-strewn stretch
without breaking a leg, Mary Hope choked back the
obstreperous lump in her throat and spoke again
in a quiet fury of resentment. &#8220;Burn it he may
if he likes; I shall <i>not</i> put my foot again inside a
house of the Lorrigans!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereat Jamie threw up his head, shied at a
white rock on the steep slope beneath, loped
through the sagebrush where the trail was almost
level, scrambled up a steep, deep-worn bit of trail,
turned the sharp corner of the switch-back and
entered that rift in the cap-rock known as the
Slide.</p>
<p>Mary Hope had traveled that trail many times
on Rab, a few years ago. She had always entered
the Slide with a little thrill along her spine, knowing
it for a place where Adventure might meet her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
face to face&ndash;&ndash;where Danger lurked and might one
day spring out at her. To-day she thought nothing
about it until Jamie squatted and tried to whirl
back. Then she looked up and saw Adventure,
Danger and Lance Lorrigan just ahead, where the
Slide was steepest.</p>
<p>Lance pulled up his hired horse, his thoughts
coming back with a jerk from the same disagreeable
subject that had engrossed Mary Hope. The
hired horse jumped, tried his best not to sit down,
lunged forward to save himself, found himself held
back with a strength that did not yield an inch,
and paused wild-eyed, his hind feet slipping and
scraping the rock.</p>
<p>Jamie in that moment was behaving much worse.
Jamie, finding that he could not turn around, was
backing down the Slide, every step threatening
to land him in a heap. Mary Hope turned white,
her eyes staring up at Lance a little above her. In
that instant they both remembered the short turn
of the switch-back, and the twelve-foot bank with
the scrambling trail down which no horse could
walk backwards and keep his legs under him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loosen the reins and spur him!&#8221; Lance&#8217;s
voice sounded hollow, pent within that rock-walled
slit. In the narrow space he was crowding his own
horse against the right wall so that he might dismount.</p>
<p>Mary Hope leaned obediently forward, the reins
hanging loose. &#8220;He <i>always</i> backs up when he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
scared,&#8221; she panted, when Jamie paid no attention.</p>
<p>Instinctively Lance&#8217;s hand felt for his rope. On
the livery saddle there did happen to be a poor sort
of grass-rope riata, cheap and stiff and clumsily
coiled, but fortunately with a loop in the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lasso Jamie! He always fights a rope.
He&#8217;ll throw himself!&#8221; Mary Hope&#8217;s voice was
strained and unnatural.</p>
<p>Lance flipped a kink out of the rope. In that
narrow space the loop must be a small one; he
had one swift, sickening vision of what might
happen if the little loop tightened around her neck.
&#8220;Put up your hands&ndash;&ndash;close to your head,&#8221; he
commanded her. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right. Don&#8217;t be
afraid&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s all right, girl&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He shot the loop straight out and down at her,
saw it settle over her head, slip over her elbows,
her shoulders. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right&ndash;&ndash;can you get off!&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried, but the space was too narrow to risk
it, with Jamie still going backward in a brainless
panic. He would have trampled her beneath him
had she done so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay on&ndash;&ndash;but be all ready to jump when he
leaves the Slide. Don&#8217;t be afraid&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s all right.
He won&#8217;t hurt you; he won&#8217;t hurt you at all.&#8221; He
was edging closer to the horse, holding the rope
taut in his right hand, his left ready to catch
Jamie by the bridle once he came near enough.
His one fear was that the horse might fall before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
he was out of the gash, and in falling might crush
Mary Hope against the rocks.</p>
<p>As Lance came on, Jamie backed faster, his
haunches dropped, his feet slipping under him.
Lance dared not crowd him, dared not reach for
the bridle, still more than an arm&#8217;s length away.
So Jamie came out of the Slide backwards, saw
with a sudden panic-stricken toss of his head that
he had open daylight all around him, whirled short
and gave one headlong leap away from the place
that had terrified him so.</p>
<p>Lance jumped, reaching for Mary Hope as the
horse went over the bank. By the length of his
hand he missed her, but the rope pulled her free
from Jamie, and she fell prone on the trail and
lay still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt? Good God! are you hurt?&#8221;
Lance gathered her in his arms and carried her to
where the rock wall made a shady band across the
steep slope.</p>
<p>Mary Hope was very white, very limp, and her
eyes were closed. On her cheeks he saw where
tears had lately been. Her mouth had a pitiful
little droop. He sat down, still holding her like a
child, and felt tentatively of her arms, her shoulders,
vaguely prepared to feel the crunch of a
broken bone. There was no water nearer than
the ranch. Jamie, having rolled over twice, was
lying on his side near a scraggly buck-brush, looking
back up the hill, apparently wondering whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
it would be worth while to get up. The hired
horse, having found a niche wherein to set his hind
feet, stood staring down through the Slide, afraid
to come farther, unable to retreat.</p>
<p>One side of Mary Hope&#8217;s face was dusty, the
skin roughened with small scratches where she had
fallen. With his handkerchief Lance very gently
wiped away the dust, took off her hat and fanned
her face, watching absently two locks of hair that
blew back and forth across her forehead with the
breeze made by the swaying hat brim.</p>
<p>She was not dead! She could not be dead, with
that short fall. Then he saw that she was breathing
faintly, unevenly, and in another minute he
saw her lashes quiver against her tanned cheek.
But her eyes did not open, the color did not flow
back into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, girl&ndash;&ndash;girl, wake up!&#8221; With a little shake
he pulled her close to him. &#8220;Open your eyes. I
want to see your eyes. I want to see if they are
just as blue as ever. Girl&ndash;&ndash;oh, you poor little
girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>He had been hating her, furious at the insult
she had given his family. Angry as he was with
the Lorrigans, resenting fiercely what they had
done, he had hated Mary Hope Douglas more, because
the hurt was more personal, struck deep into
a part of his soul that had grown tender. But he
could not hate her now&ndash;&ndash;not when she lay there in
his arms with her tear-stained cheek against his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
heart, her eyes shut, and with that pathetic droop
to her lips. Gently he tucked back the locks of
hair that kept blowing across her forehead. Very
tenderly, with a whimsical pretense at self-pity,
he upbraided her for the trouble she was giving
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I go clear down to the ranch and pack up
water in my hat, and slosh it on your face? I&#8217;ll do
that, girl, if you don&#8217;t open your eyes and look at
me. <i>You&#8217;re</i> not hurt; <i>are</i> you hurt? You&#8217;d better
wake up and tell me, or I&#8217;ll have to take you
right up in my arms and carry you all the way
down to the house, and ride like heck for a doctor,
and&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye will not!&#8221; she retorted faintly, and unexpectedly
he was looking into her eyes, bluer than
he had remembered them; troubled, questioning&ndash;&ndash;but
stubborn against his suggestion. She moved
uneasily, and he lifted her to the bank beside him
and put one arm behind her, so that she leaned
against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well&ndash;&ndash;then I will not. You&#8217;ll walk
with me to the house, and we&#8217;ll let Belle&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not! Never in my life will I enter the
house of a Lorrigan!&#8221; Mary Hope brushed a
palm against her forehead, straightened herself as
if she resented her weakness, wished to hold herself
aloof from him. She did not look at Lance, but
stared across the narrow valley to the sage-clothed
bluff beyond.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why not? You&#8217;ve just come from the Lorrigans,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; Lance studied her face.
&#8220;You must have, or you wouldn&#8217;t be on this trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went down to pay for the schoolhouse, since
your father took the piano away.&ndash;&ndash;And he would
not take the money, and he said he would burn the
house if I don&#8217;t teach in it&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;ll die before
ever I&#8217;ll open the door again, unless he takes the
money. And he said if I left the money he would
throw it down the crevice yonder&ndash;&ndash;and he would
<i>do</i> it! And do you think I&#8217;ll be under any obligation
to Tom Lorrigan? You called my father
hard, but your father is the hardest man that ever
lived. The Lorrigans shall <i>not</i>&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance laughed, set her hat wrong side before on
her head, tucked the elastic band under her chin,
laughed again when she pettishly removed it and
set the hat straight. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry over the
schoolhouse right now&ndash;&ndash;nor Tom Lorrigan
either,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Look at your horse down there.
If you&#8217;re all right, I&#8217;ll go down and see how many
bones he&#8217;s broken. You had a chance for a nasty
pile-up. Do you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful,&#8221; said Mary Hope soberly.
&#8220;But it was Lorrigan meanness brought me here;
it was a Lorrigan got me into the trouble now, and
a Lorrigan got me out of it. It&#8217;s <i>always</i> the Lorrigans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and a Lorrigan&#8217;s got to see you a little
farther before you&#8217;re through with them, so cheer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
up.&#8221; Lance laughed again, an amused little
chuckle that was calculated to take the droop out
of Mary Hope&#8217;s lips, and failed completely.</p>
<p>He saw her cheeks were reddening, saw too that
her face gave evidence of no particular bodily pain.
She had probably fainted from fright, more than
anything else, he decided, and her fright was now
forgotten in her animosity. He slid off the bank,
went down to where Jamie lay, took him by the
bridle and urged him to stand. Which Jamie,
after one or two scrambling attempts, managed
to do. But the horse was hurt. He could scarcely
hobble to the trail.</p>
<p>Without paying any visible attention to Mary
Hope, Lance removed her saddle from Jamie, and
brought it up to where she sat dispiritedly watching
him. His manner was brisk, kind enough, but
had an aloofness which made her keenly aware
that he accepted her adherence to the feud and
tacitly took his own place with the Lorrigans.
Over this emergency she felt that he had unspokenly
set a flag of truce. His attitude depressed
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are just two things to do,&#8221; he said, laying
the saddle at her feet. &#8220;You may ride that
livery horse back home, and I&#8217;ll come along to-morrow
and pick him up and take him in with me
to Jumpoff; or you can let me go down to the ranch
and bring up a gentle horse, and you can ride that
home. I can get him when I come out to-morrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
with my traps. I advise you to take the gentle
horse from the ranch, after the shake-up you&#8217;ve
had. This town horse is not easy gaited, by any
means. Your horse I&#8217;ll manage to get down to
the ranch and do what I can for him. It&#8217;s his
shoulder, I think, from the way he acts. He may
be all right after a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope looked distressfully at Jamie, standing
dejected where Lance had left him, his head
sagging, every line of him showing how sick of
life he was. She glanced swiftly up at Lance, bent
her head suddenly and pressed the tips of her fingers
along her cheek bones, wiping away tears
that came brimming over her eyelids.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better let me bring up a horse and take
you home,&#8221; Lance urged, the caressing note creeping
into his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I can&#8217;t! I&ndash;&ndash;what do I care how I
get home? But if your father won&#8217;t take the
money&ndash;&ndash;You don&#8217;t <i>know!</i> The whole Rim talks
and gossips until I wish I were dead! And I can&#8217;t
go on using the schoolhouse&ndash;&ndash;and Tom Lorrigan
says if I don&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She was crying at last, silently,
miserably, her face hidden behind her
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll take the money.&#8221; Lance, after an indeterminate
minute while he watched her, laid his
hand lightly on her shoulder. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see that dad
takes it. And I&#8217;ll give you a bill of sale that
ought to shut the Black Rim mouths. I&#8217;m a Lorrigan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
and I&#8217;m not going to apologize for the blood
that&#8217;s in me, but I want you to know that if I had
been home on the night of the Fourth the Lorrigans
wouldn&#8217;t have done the rotten cheap thing
they did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope heard him tearing a leaf out of his
memorandum book, looked up at him while he
wrote rapidly. Without any comment whatever
he gave her the paper, went up to where the hired
horse stood, and coaxed it down through the Slide.
Quickly, with the deftness that told of lifelong intimacy
with horses and saddles, he set her own
saddle on the hired horse, while Mary Hope read
the terse bill of sale that set forth the legal &#8220;Ten
dollars and other valuable considerations,&#8221; and
was signed &#8220;Thomas Lorrigan, per L. M. Lorrigan.&#8221;
It all seemed very businesslike, and heartened
her so much that she was willing to be nice
to Lance Lorrigan. But Lance remained strictly
neutral.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lead him up the Slide for you,&#8221; he said
unemotionally when the horse was ready. &#8220;After
he&#8217;s over that, I think you&#8217;ll be all right; you&#8217;re
a good rider. And you need not feel under any
obligations then to the Lorrigans. I was practically
through with the horse, anyway, and it will be
no trouble at all to drive by your place and get him
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can lead him up&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Mary Hope began, but
Lance had already turned the horse and started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
him up the Slide, so there was nothing for her to
do but follow.</p>
<p>At the top she gave him the money bag, which he
took without any words whatever on the subject.
He held the horse until she had mounted, made
sure that she was all right, chilled by his perfect
politeness her nervous overture toward a more
friendly parting, lifted his hat and turned immediately
to go back down the Slide.</p>
<p>Mary Hope glanced back over her shoulder and
saw his bobbing hat crown. &#8220;Ah, he&#8217;s just a
Lorrigan, and I hate them all. But he let me pay&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
quits with them now&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;ll never in my
life speak to one of them again!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY</h2>
<h3>AS HE LIVED, SO HE DIED</h3>
</div>
<p>Belle Lorrigan, with Lance beside her on
the one seat of the swaying buckboard, swung
through the open gate of the Douglas yard and
drove to the sun-baked, empty corral. In the
doorway of the house, as they dashed past, the
bent body of Mother Douglas appeared. She
stood staring after them, her eyes blurred with
tears. &#8220;It&#8217;s that huzzy, the Lorrigan woman,&#8221;
she said flatly, wiping her face on her checked
apron, stiffly starched and very clean. &#8220;Do you
go, Mary Hope, and get them the horse they&#8217;ve
come for. If Hugh were here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>From somewhere within the house the voice of
Aleck Douglas rose suddenly in a high-keyed
vindictive chanting. Mother Douglas turned, but
the old man came with a rush across the floor,
brushed past her and went swaying drunkenly to
the corral, shouting meaningless threats. After
him went Mary Hope, her eyes wide, her skirt
flapping about her ankles as she ran.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please do not pay any attention to father!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
she cried, hurrying to overtake him before he
reached the buckboard. &#8220;He&#8217;s out of his head
with pain, and he will not have a doctor&ndash;&ndash;Father!
listen! They only came for the horse I borrowed
yesterday&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re going directly&ndash;&ndash;come back
and get into your bed, father!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aleck Douglas was picking up a broken neck
yoke for a weapon when Lance sprang out over a
wheel and grappled with him. The old man&#8217;s
right arm was swollen to twice its natural size and
bandaged to his shoulder. His eyes were bloodshot,
his breath fetid with the fever that burned
him when he turned his face close to Lance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s his arm makes him crazy,&#8221; said Mary
Hope breathlessly. &#8220;Last night it began, and
mother and I cannot keep him in his bed, and we
don&#8217;t know <i>what</i> to do! He will not have a doctor,
he says&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better have,&#8221; said Belle shortly, hanging
to the pintos that danced and snorted at the
excitement. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send one out. Lance, you better
stay here and look after him&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll kill somebody
yet. Aren&#8217;t there any men on the place, for
heaven&#8217;s sake?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope said there wasn&#8217;t, that Hugh was
not expected back before night. They had bought
a horse from the Millers, and it had jumped the
fence and gone home, and Hugh had gone after it.
Then she ran to do what she could to calm her
father. Scotty, it would seem, wanted to drive the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
Lorrigans off his land because they were thieves
and cutthroats and had come there to rob him
boldly in the broad light of day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bat him on the head if you have to, Lance,&#8221;
Belle called, cold-eyed but capable. &#8220;He&#8217;ll get
sunstroke out here in this heat. And if you can
get him into the house you had better tie him down
till a doctor comes.&#8221; Then she left, with the pintos
circling in a lope to get out through the gate
and into the trail.</p>
<p>The last she saw of them, Lance and Mary Hope
were both struggling with the old man, forcing him
foot by foot to the house, where Mother Douglas
stood on the doorstep crying, with her apron to her
face.</p>
<p>She had the tough little team in a white lather,
with their stubborn heads hanging level with their
knees, when she stopped at the little railroad station
and sent a peremptory wire to the Lava doctor
who was most popular in the Black Rim. She
waited until he arrived on the train which he luckily
had time to catch, and then, the pintos having
somewhat recovered under the solicitous rubbing-down
of a hollow-chested stableman, she hustled
the doctor and his black case into the buckboard
and made the return drive in one hour and fifty
minutes, which was breaking even her own record,
who was called the hardest driver in the whole Rim
country.</p>
<p>They found Lance with his coat off and the perspiration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
streaming down his face, battling with
Aleck Douglas who was raving still of the Lorrigans
and threatening to kill this one who would
not leave him alone to die in peace. Mary Hope
and her mother were in the hot little kitchen where
the last of the sunlight streamed through the faded
green mosquito netting that sagged in and out as
the breeze of sundown pushed through lazily.</p>
<p>The Lava doctor did not say much. He quieted
the raving with his hypodermic needle, removed
the amateurish bandage from the hand and the
arm, looked at the wound, applied a cooling lotion,
and dexterously wound on a fresh bandage. It
seemed very little, Mary Hope thought dully, for
a doctor to come all the way from Lava to do.</p>
<p>He would stay all night, he said. And the Lorrigans
went home silent, depressed, even Belle
finding nothing to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride over in the morning and see how he
is,&#8221; Lance observed, as the tired little team
climbed the Devil&#8217;s Tooth Ridge. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to
get the horse, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning, when he arrived rather early,
he learned from Mary Hope that her father had
died just before daylight, and that Hugh had not
come back, and the doctor wanted to be taken to
Jumpoff, and she could not leave her mother there
alone, and a coffin must be ordered, and she did not
know <i>what</i> to do. She was past tears, it seemed to
Lance. She was white and worn and worried, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
there was something in her eyes that made them
too tragic to look at. He stood just outside the
kitchen door and talked with her in a low voice so
that Mother Douglas, weeping audibly in the
kitchen, need not know he was there.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor can ride that livery horse in,&#8221; he
said soothingly. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll wire to Lava for anything
that you want, and notify any friends you
would like to have come and see you through this.&#8221;
He was very careful not to accent the word friends,
but Mary Hope gave him a quick, pathetic glance
when he said it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been kind&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t say just what
I would like to say&ndash;&ndash;but you&#8217;ve been kinder than
some friends would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>She left the doorstep and walked with him to the
stable, Lance leading his horse and slowing his
pace to match her weary steps. &#8220;It&ndash;&ndash;seems unreal,
like something I&#8217;m dreaming. And&ndash;&ndash;and I
hope you won&#8217;t pay any attention to what father&ndash;&ndash;said.
He was out of his mind, and while he had
the belief, he&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not talk about that,&#8221; Lance interrupted
quietly. &#8220;Your father believed that we&#8217;re
all of us thieves, that we stole his stock. Perhaps
you believe it&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ve a hard
name, got when the country was hard and it took
hard men to survive. I don&#8217;t think the Lorrigans,
when you come right down to it, were any worse
than their neighbors. They&#8217;re no worse now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
They got the name of being worse, just because
they were&ndash;&ndash;well, stronger; harder to bully,
harder to defeat. The Lorrigans could hold their
own and then some. They&#8217;re still holding their
own. There never was a Lorrigan ever yet backed
down from anything, so I&#8217;m not going to back
down from the name the Rim has given us. I&#8217;m
<i>glad</i> I&#8217;m a Lorrigan. But I&#8217;m not glad to have
you hate me for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were at the stable door, which Mary Hope
pulled open. The hired horse stood in the second
stall. Lance dropped the reins of his own horse,
turned to Mary Hope and laid his hands on her
shoulders, looking down enigmatically into her upturned,
troubled face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl, don&#8217;t let us worry you at all. You&#8217;ve
got trouble enough, and I&#8217;m going to do all I can
to help you through it. I&#8217;ll send out friends; and
then the Lorrigans won&#8217;t bother you. We won&#8217;t
come to the funeral, because your father wouldn&#8217;t
like to see us around, and your mother wouldn&#8217;t
like to see us around, and you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8221; Mary Hope drooped her face until
her forehead rested on Lance&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>Lance quivered a little. &#8220;Girl&ndash;&ndash;girl, what is
it about you that drives a man mad with tenderness
for you, sometimes?&#8221; He slipped his free
arm around her shoulders, pressed her close.
&#8220;Oh, girl&ndash;&ndash;girl! Don&#8217;t hate Lance&ndash;&ndash;just because
he&#8217;s a Lorrigan. Be fairer than that.&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
bent his head to kiss her, drew himself suddenly
straight, his brows frowning.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&ndash;&ndash;run back and ask your mother what
all she would like to have done for her in town, and
tell the doctor that I&#8217;ll have the horse ready for
him in about two minutes. And be game&ndash;&ndash;just
go on being game. Your friends will be here just
as soon as I can get them here.&#8221; He turned into
the stable and began saddling the horse.</p>
<p>Mary Hope, after a moment of indecision, went
back to the house, walking slowly, as though she
dreaded entering again to take up the heavy burden
of sorrow that must be borne with all its sordid
details, all the meaningless little conventions
that attend the passing of a human soul. She had
not loved her father very much. He was not a
man to be loved. But his going was a bereavement,
would leave a desolate emptiness in her life.
Her mother would fill with weeping reminiscence
the hours she would have spent in complaining
of his harshness. She herself must somehow take
charge of the ranch, must somehow fill her father&#8217;s
place that seemed all at once so big, so important
in her world.</p>
<p>She looked back, wistfully, saw Lance leading
out the horse. He had told her to be game&ndash;&ndash;to
go on being game. She wondered if he knew just
how hard it was going to be for her. He had said
that the Lorrigans were strong, were harder to
defeat, had always held their own. He was proud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
because of their strength! She lifted her head,
carefully wiped the tears from her cheeks&ndash;&ndash;Mary
Hope seemed always to be wiping tears from her
cheeks lately!&ndash;&ndash;and opened the door. The Lorrigans?
Very well, there was also the Douglas
blood, and that was not weaker than the Lorrigan.</p>
<p>She was quite calm, quite impersonal when she
gave Lance a list of the pitifully small errands
she and her mother would be grateful if he would
perform for them. Her lips did not quiver, her
hands did not tremble when she took her father&#8217;s
old red morocco wallet from the bureau drawer
and gave Lance money to pay for the things they
would need. Or if he would just hand the list to
the Kennedys, she told him, they would be glad
to attend to everything and save him the bother.
They would come out at once, and perhaps Mrs.
Smith would come. She thanked him civilly for
the trouble he had already taken and added a message
of thanks for Belle. She thanked him for the
use of the horse and for attending to the schoolhouse
matter for her. She was so extremely
thankful that Lance exploded in one two-word oath
when he rode away. Whereupon the doctor, who
knew nothing of Lance&#8217;s thoughts, looked at him in
astonishment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h2>
<h3>LANCE TRAILS A MYSTERY</h3>
</div>
<p>Lance, rising at what he considered an early
hour&ndash;&ndash;five in the morning may well be considered
early,&ndash;&ndash;went whistling down to the corral
to see what plans were on for the day. It was
the day of Aleck Douglas&#8217;s funeral, but the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth outfit would be represented only by a
wreath of white carnations which Belle had ordered
sent up from Pocatello. White carnations
and Aleck Douglas did not seem to harmonize, but
neither did the Devil&#8217;s Tooth and Aleck Douglas,
and the white wreath would be much less conspicuous
and far more acceptable than the Lorrigans,
Lance was thinking.</p>
<p>He paused at the bunk-house and looked in.
The place was deserted. He walked through it
to the kitchen where the boys ate&ndash;&ndash;the chuck-house,
they called it&ndash;&ndash;and found nothing to indicate
that a meal had been eaten there lately. He
went out and down to the stable, where Sam Pretty
Cow was just finishing his stall cleaning. Shorty,
who now had a permanently lame leg from falling
under his horse up in the Lava Beds a year ago,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
was limping across the first corral with two full
milk buckets in his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what time does this ranch get up, for heck
sake?&#8221; Lance inquired of Sam Pretty Cow, stepping
aside so that Sam might carry in a forkful of
fresh hay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno&ndash;&ndash;long time ago.&#8221; Sam Pretty Cow
turned the hay sidewise and went in to stuff his
fragrant burden into the manger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going out with the boys, if they went anywhere.
Where have they all headed for, Sam?
I could overtake them, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow, returning to the doorway,
shifted a quid of tobacco from one cheek to the
other and grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno, me,&#8221; he responded amiably.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t <i>know?</i> Didn&#8217;t dad say anything?
Didn&#8217;t the boys?&#8221; And then, with faint exasperation,
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t any one ever talk any more on this
ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow gave him a swift, oblique glance
and spat accurately at a great horsefly that had
lighted on a board end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much, you bet. Nh-hn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance called to Shorty, who had set his milk
buckets down that he might open the little gate
that swung inward,&ndash;&ndash;the gate which horses were
not supposed to know anything about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh-h, Shorty! Where did dad and the boys
go this morning?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>Shorty turned slowly, pulling the gate open and
propping it with a stick until he had set the buckets
through. Deliberation was in his manner, deliberation
was in his speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Las&#8217; night, you mean. They hit out right
after midnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where did they <i>go?</i>&#8221; Lance ground his
cigarette under his heel.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might ask &#8217;em when they git back,&#8221;
Shorty suggested cryptically, and closed the gate
just as carefully as if forty freedom-hungry horses
were milling inside the corral.</p>
<p>Lance watched him go and turned to Sam Pretty
Cow who, having thrust his hay fork behind a
brace in the stable wall, was preparing to vary his
tobacco-chewing with a smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the mystery, Sam? Where did they
go? I&#8217;m here to stay, and I&#8217;m one of the family&ndash;&ndash;I
<i>think</i>&ndash;&ndash;and you may as well tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow lipped the edge of his cigarette
paper, folded it down smoothly on the tiny roll of
tobacco, leaned his body backward and painstakingly
drew a match from the small pocket of his
grimy blue overalls.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m don&#8217; <i>know</i> nothing,&#8221; he vouchsafed equably.
&#8220;I&#8217;m don&#8217; ask nothing. I&#8217;m don&#8217; hear nothing.
You bet. Nh-hn&ndash;&ndash;yore damn right.&#8221;</p>
<p>From under his lashes Lance watched Sam
Pretty Cow. &#8220;I was over helping hold old Scotty
in his bed, the other day,&#8221; he said irrelevantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
&#8220;He was crazy&ndash;&ndash;out of his head. He kept yelling
that the Lorrigans were stealing his stock.
He kept saying that a few more marks with a
straight branding iron would turn his Eleven into
an NL, ANL, DNL, LNL&ndash;&ndash;any one of the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth brands. Crazy with fever, he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow studied the match, decided
which was the head of it, and drew it sharply along
his boot sole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&ndash;&ndash;yo&#8217;re damn right. Crazy, you bet
yore life. Uh-huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said the Miller&#8217;s Block brand could easily
be turned into the N Block&ndash;&ndash;Belle&#8217;s brand. He
said horses had been run off the range&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; Sam observed unemotionally.
&#8220;You bet. He&#8217;s gettin&#8217; fun&#8217;ral to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will the boys be out?&#8221; Lance pulled
a splinter off the rail beside him and began separating
the fibers with his finger nails that were
too well cared for to belong to the Black Rim folk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno, me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scotty sure was crazy, Sam. He tried twice to
kill me. Once he jumped up and ran into the
kitchen and grabbed a butcher knife off the table
and came at me. He thought I was there to rob
him. He called me Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said Sam Pretty Cow, blowing smoke.
&#8220;He&#8217;s damn lucky you ain&#8217;t Tom. Uh-huh&ndash;&ndash;you
bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance lifted his eyebrows, was silent while he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
watched Shorty limping down from the house, this
time with table scraps for the chickens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scotty was certainly crazy,&#8221; Lance turned
again to Sam. &#8220;Over and over he kept saying,
while he looked up at the ceiling, &#8216;The Lorrigan
days are numbered. Though the wicked flourish
like a green bay tree, they shall perish as dry
grass. The days are numbered&ndash;&ndash;their evil days
are numbered.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow smoked, flicked the ash from
his cigarette with a coppery forefinger, looked suddenly
full at Lance and grinned widely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. So&#8217;s them stars numbered, all right.
I dunno, me. Tom Lorrigan&#8217;s damn smart man.&#8221;
He reached down for an old bridle and grinned
again. &#8220;Scotty, I guess he don&#8217; say how many
numbers them days is, you bet.&#8221; He started off,
trailing his bridle reins carelessly in the dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to catch up a horse, Sam, I
wish you&#8217;d haze in the best one on the ranch for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow paused, half turned, spat meditatively
into the dust and jerked a thumb toward
the stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, I dunno. Bes&#8217; horse on the ranch is in
them box stall. Them&#8217;s Coaley. I guess you don&#8217;
want Coaley, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance bit his lip, looking at Sam Pretty Cow intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t catch up a horse for me, Sam.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
I&#8217;ll ride Coaley,&#8221; he said smoothly. Which
brought a surprised grunt from Sam Pretty Cow,
Indian though he was, accustomed though he was
to the ways of the Lorrigans.</p>
<p>But it was not his affair if Lance and his father
quarreled when Tom returned. Indeed, Tom
might not return very soon, in which case he would
not hear anything about Lance&#8217;s audacity unless
Lance himself told it. Sam Pretty Cow would
never mention it, and Shorty would not say a word.
Shorty never did say anything if he could by any
means keep silence.</p>
<p>Lance returned to the house, taking long strides
that, without seeming hurried, yet suggested haste.
He presently came down the path again, this time
with a blanket roll and a sack with lumpy things
tied in the bottom. He wore chaps, his spurs,
carried a yellow slicker over his arm. On his head
was a black Stetson, one of Tom&#8217;s discarded old
hats.</p>
<p>He led Coaley from the box stall where he had
never before seen him stand, saddled him, tied his
bundles compactly behind the cantle, mounted and
rode down the trail, following the hoof prints that
showed freshest in the loose, gravelly sand.
Coaley, plainly glad to be out of his prison, stepped
daintily along in a rocking half trot that would
carry him more miles in a day than any other
horse in the country could cover, and bring him to
the journey&#8217;s end with springy gait and head held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
proudly, ears twitching, ready for more miles if
his rider wanted more.</p>
<p>The tracks led up the road to the Ridge, turned
sharply off where the brush grew scanty among
the flat rocks that just showed their faces above
the surface of the arid soil. Lance frowned and
followed. For a long way he skirted the rim rock
that edged the sheer bluff. A scant furlong away,
on his right, a trail ran west to the broken land of
Indian Creek. But since the horsemen had chosen
to keep to the rocky ground along the rim, Lance
followed.</p>
<p>He had gone perhaps a mile along the bluff
when Coaley began to toss up his head and perk
his ears backward, turning now and then to look.
Lance was sunk too deep in bitter introspection
to observe these first warning movements which
every horseman knows. He was thinking of Mary
Hope, who would be waking now to a day of sorrowful
excitement. Thinking, too, of old Aleck
Douglas and the things that he had said in his
raving.</p>
<p>What Douglas had shouted hoarsely was not
true, of course. He did not believe,&ndash;&ndash;and yet,
there was Shorty&#8217;s enigmatical answer to a simple
question; there was Sam Pretty Cow, implying
much while he actually said very little; there was
this unheralded departure of all the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
riders in the night, in the season between round-ups.
There was Coaley feeling fit for anything,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
shut up in the box stall while Tom rode another
horse; and here was Lance himself taking the trail
of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit at a little after sunrise
on a horse tacitly forbidden to all riders save Tom.</p>
<p>Coaley, in a place where he must pick his way
between boulders, paused and lifted his head, staring
back the way they had come. Lance roused
himself from gloomy speculations and looked back
also, but he could not see anything behind them
save a circling hawk and the gray monotone of the
barren plateau, so he urged Coaley in among the
boulders.</p>
<p>There must be something back there, of course.
Coaley was too intelligent a horse to make a mistake.
But it might be some drifting range stock,
or perhaps a stray horse. Certainly it was no one
from the Devil&#8217;s Tooth, for Sam Pretty Cow had
set off to mend a fence in the lower pasture, and
Shorty never rode a horse nowadays for more than
a half mile or so; and six o&#8217;clock in the morning
would be rather early for chance riders from any
other ranch. With a shrug, Lance dismissed the
matter from his mind.</p>
<p>Where a faint, little-used trail went obliquely
down the bluff to the creek bottom, Lance saw
again the hoofprints which the rocky ground had
failed to reveal. He could see no reason for taking
this roundabout course to go up the creek, but
he sent Coaley down the trail, reached the bottom
and discovered that the tracks once more struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
off into rocky ground. His face hardened until
his resemblance to Tom became more marked than
usual, but where the tracks led he followed. Too
often had he trailed stray horses in the past to be
puzzled now, whether he could see the hoofprints
or not.</p>
<p>They must have made for the other side of the
creek, gone up Wild Horse gulch or the Little
Squaw. There was just one place where they
could cross the creek without bogging in the tricky
mud that was almost as bad as quicksand. He
therefore pulled out of the rocky patch and made
straight for the crossing. He would soon know if
they had crossed there. If they had not, then they
would have turned again up Squaw Creek, and it
would be short work cutting straight across to the
only possible trail to the higher country.</p>
<p>He had covered half of the distance to the creek
when Coaley again called his attention to something
behind him. This time Lance glimpsed what
looked very much like the crown of a hat moving
in a dry wash that he had crossed not more than
five minutes before. He pulled up, studied the
contour of the ground behind him, looked ahead,
saw the mark of a shod hoof between two rocks.
The hoof mark pointed toward the crossing.
Lance, however, turned down another small depression
where the soil lay bare and Coaley left
clean imprints, trotted along it until a welter of
rocks made bad footing for the horse, climbed out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
and went on level. Farther up the valley an
abrupt curve in Squaw Creek barred his way with
scraggly, thin willow growth that had winding cow
trails running through it. Into one of these Lance
turned, rode deep into the sparse growth, stopped
where the trail swung round a huge, detached
boulder, dismounted and dropped Coaley&#8217;s reins to
the ground and retraced his steps some distance
from the trail, stepping on rocks here and there
and keeping off damp spots.</p>
<p>He reached the thin edge of the grove, stood
behind a stocky bush and waited. In two or three
minutes&ndash;&ndash;they seemed ten to Lance&ndash;&ndash;he saw the
head and shoulders of a rider just emerging from
the gully he himself had so lately followed.</p>
<p>Back on Coaley, following the winding trail,
Lance pondered the matter. The way he had come
was no highway&ndash;&ndash;no trail that any rider would
follow on any business save one. But just why
should he be followed? He had thought at first
that some one was trailing the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit,
as he had been doing, but now it seemed plain
that he himself was the quarry.</p>
<p>He flicked the reins on Coaley&#8217;s satiny neck, and
the horse broke at once into a springy, swift trot,
following the purposeless winding of the cow path.
When they emerged upon the other side where the
creek gurgled over a patch of rocks like cobblestones,
Lance stopped and let him take a sip or two
of water, then struck off toward the bluff, letting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Coaley choose his own pace, taking care that he
kept to low ground where he could not be seen.</p>
<p>For an hour he rode and came to the junction
of Mill Creek and the Squaw. Then, climbing
through chokecherry thickets up a draw that led
by winding ways to higher ground, Lance stopped
and scrutinized the bottomland over which
he had passed. Coaley stood alert, watching also
that back trail, his ears turned forward, listening.
After a moment, he began to take little mincing
steps sidewise, pulling impatiently at the reins.
As plainly as a horse could tell it, Coaley implored
Lance to go on. But Lance waited until, crossing
an open space, he saw a rider coming along at a
shambling trot on the trail he had himself lately
followed.</p>
<p>He frowned thoughtfully, turned Coaley toward
home and rode swiftly in a long, distance-devouring
lope.</p>
<p>He reached the ranch somewhere near ten
o&#8217;clock, surprising Belle in the act of harnessing
her pintos to a new buckboard at which they shied
hypocritically. Belle stared at him round-eyed
over the backs of her team.</p>
<p>&#8220;My good Lord, Lance! You&ndash;&ndash;you could be
Tom&#8217;s twin, in that hat and on that horse! What
you been doing&ndash;&ndash;doubling for him in a lead?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance swung down and came toward her.
&#8220;Belle, where did dad and the boys go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;fussing with the stock,&#8221; said Belle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
vaguely, her eyes clouding a little. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting
so many cattle it keeps Tom on the go day and
night, seems to me. And he <i>will</i> keep buying more
all the while. Did&ndash;&ndash;did you want to go with
them, honey? I guess Tom never thought you
might. You&#8217;ve been away so long. You&#8217;d better
not ride Coaley, Lance. Tom would just about
murder you if he caught you at it. And where did
you get hold of that hat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance laughed queerly. &#8220;I just picked it off
the table as I came out. Mine is too new and stiff
yet. This seemed to fit. And Coaley&#8217;s better off
under the saddle than he is in the stable, Belle.
He&#8217;s a peach&ndash;&ndash;I always did want to ride Coaley,
but I never had the nerve till I got big enough to
lick dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught Belle in a quick, breath-taking hug,
kissed her swiftly on the cheek and turned Coaley
into the corral with the saddle still on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going over&ndash;&ndash;to the funeral?&#8221; he
asked as he closed the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to town, and I&#8217;ve got the letters you
left on the table to be mailed. No, I&#8217;m not going
to the funeral. I don&#8217;t enjoy having my face
slapped&ndash;&ndash;and being called a painted Jezebel,&#8221;
she added dryly.</p>
<p>Under his breath Lance muttered something and
went into the house, not looking at Belle or making
her any reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance,&#8221; said Belle to the pintos, &#8220;thinks we&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
rough and tough and just about half civilized.
Lord, when you take a Lorrigan and educate him
and <i>polish</i> him, you sure have got a combination
that&#8217;s hard to go up against. Two years&ndash;&ndash;and
my heavens, I don&#8217;t <i>know</i> Lance any more! I
never thought any Lorrigan could feaze <i>me</i>&ndash;&ndash;but
there&#8217;s something about Lance&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>In the house Lance was not showing any of the
polish which Belle had mentioned rather regretfully.
He was kneeling before a trunk, throwing
books and pipes and socks and soft-toned silk
shirts over his shoulder, looking for something
which he seemed in a great haste to find. When
his fingers, prying deep among his belongings,
closed upon the thing he sought, he brought it up,
frowning abstractedly.</p>
<p>A black leather case, small and curved, opened
when he unbuckled the confining strap. A binocular,
small but extremely efficient in its magnifying
power he withdrew, dusting the lenses with
the sleeve of his shirt. He had bought the glasses
because some one had advised him to take a pair
along when he went with a party of friends to the
top of Mount Tamalpais one Sunday. And because
he had an instinctive dislike for anything
but the best obtainable, he had bought the highest-priced
glasses he could find in San Francisco,&ndash;&ndash;and
perhaps the smallest. He buckled them back
into their case, slapped them into his pocket and
closed the trunk lid with a bang. From the mantel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
in the living room he gleaned a box of cartridges
for an extra six-shooter, which he cleaned and
loaded carefully and tucked inside the waistband
of his trousers, on the left side, following an instinct
that brought him close to his grandfather,
that old killer whom all men feared to anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;The horse and the hat; he thought it was dad
he was trailing!&#8221; he said to himself, with his teeth
clamped tight together. &#8220;Oh, well, when it comes
to that kind of a game&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He went out and down to the corral, watered
Coaley and mounted again, taking the trail across
pastures to Squaw Creek.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h2>
<h3>LANCE RIDES ANOTHER TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>With a two-days&#8217; growth of beard on his chin
and jaws, a new, hard look in his eyes and
the general appearance of a man who has been riding
long and has slept in all his clothes, Lance rode
quietly up to the corral gate and dismounted. A
certain stiffness was in his walk when he led
Coaley inside and turned a stirrup up over the
saddle horn, his gloved fingers dropping to the
latigo. Lance was tired&ndash;&ndash;any one could see that
at a glance. That he was preoccupied, and that
his preoccupation was not pleasant, was also
evident to the least observing eye.</p>
<p>Tom, coming out of the bunk house, studied him
with narrowed lids as he came walking leisurely
down to the corral. Tom&#8217;s movements also betrayed
a slight stiffness of the muscles, as though
he had ridden hard and long. He did not hurry.
Lance had pulled off the saddle and the sweaty
blanket and the bridle, and had turned Coaley into
the corral before he knew that some one was coming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
Even then he did not turn to look. He was
staring hard at a half-dozen horses grouped in the
farther corner of the corral,&ndash;&ndash;horses with gaunt
flanks and the wet imprint of saddles. They were
hungrily nosing fresh piles of hay, and scarcely
looked up when Coaley trotted eagerly up to join
them. Six of them&ndash;&ndash;a little more than half of
the outfit that had ridden away the other night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! I see you helped yourself to a new saddle
horse,&#8221; Tom observed significantly, coming up
behind Lance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Coaley acted lonesome, shut up in the
box stall. Thought a little riding would do him
good.&#8221; Lance&#8217;s eyes met Tom&#8217;s calmly, almost
as if the two were mere acquaintances.</p>
<p>&#8220;You give him a plenty, looks like. Where yuh
been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Oh&ndash;&ndash;just riding around.&#8221; Lance stooped
indifferently to untie his slicker and blanket from
the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d like to use him myself. Thinking
some of riding into town this afternoon,&#8221; Tom
said, still studying Lance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you want to ride Coaley, he&#8217;s good for
it. I&#8217;d say he has more miles in him yet than any
of that bunch over there.&#8221; With slicker and
blanket roll Lance started for the house.</p>
<p>Tom did not say anything. He was scowling
thoughtfully after Lance when Belle, coming from
the chicken house with a late hatching of fluffy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
little chicks in her hat, looked at him inquiringly.
To her Tom turned with more harshness than he
had shown for many a long day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schoolin&#8217; don&#8217;t seem to set good on a Lorrigan,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;How long&#8217;s he goin&#8217; to stay this
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, honey, don&#8217;t you <i>want</i> Lance home? He
rode Coaley&ndash;&ndash;but that&#8217;s no crime. Lance
wouldn&#8217;t hurt him, he&#8217;s too good a rider and he
never was hard on horses. And Coaley just goes
<i>wild</i> when he has to stand shut up all day&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it ain&#8217;t riding Coaley, altogether. He can
ride Coaley and be darned. It&#8217;s the new airs he&#8217;s
putting on that don&#8217;t set good with me, Belle.
You wanted to make something of Lance, and now,
by Henry, you&#8217;ll have to name the job you&#8217;ve
made of him&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d hate to!&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle put a hand into the cheeping huddle in
her hat, lifted out a chick and held it to her cheek.
&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re just imagining that Lance is different,&#8221;
she contended, stifling her own recognition
of the change. &#8220;He&#8217;ll settle right down amongst
the boys&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys ain&#8217;t cryin&#8217; to have him, Belle.
Black Rimmers had ought to stay Black Rimmers,
or get out and stay out. Lance ain&#8217;t either one
thing or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Tom Lorrigan!&#8221; Belle dropped the
chick into her hat and tucked the hat under her
arm. Her eyes began to sparkle a little. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
don&#8217;t think Lance liked it about the piano, but he&#8217;s
the same Lance he always was. I&#8217;ve watched him,
and he hasn&#8217;t said a thing or done a thing outa the
way&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s just the <i>dearest</i> great big fellow!
And I can&#8217;t for the life of me see why you and the
whole outfit hang back from him like he was a
stranger. Education ain&#8217;t catching, Tom. And
Lance don&#8217;t put on any airs at all, so why in the
name of heaven you all&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, don&#8217;t get all excited, Belle. But if
education was ketching, a lot of the boys would be
rollin&#8217; their beds. I&#8217;m going to town. Anything
yuh want brought out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle did not answer. She went away to the
house with her hatful of chicks, and put them into
a box close to the stove until the mother hen made
sure whether the four other eggs were anything
more than just stale eggs. It would have been
hard for Belle to explain just what the heaviness
in her heart portended. Certainly it was not in
her nature to worry over trifles,&ndash;&ndash;yet these were
apparent trifles that worried her. On the surface
of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth life only faint ripples stirred,
but Belle felt somehow as though she were floating
in a frail boat over a quiet pool from whose depths
some unspeakable monster might presently thrust
an ominous head and drag her under.</p>
<p>In the crude yet wholly adequate bathroom she
heard a great splashing, and guessed that it was
Lance, refreshing himself after his trip. That,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
she supposed, was another point that set him apart
from the other boys. From June to September,
whenever any of the male inhabitants of the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth felt the need of ablutions beyond the
scope of a blue enamel wash basin, he took a limp
towel and rode down across the pasture to the
creek, and swam for half an hour or so in a certain
deep pool. Sometimes all of the boys went, at sundown,
and filled the pool with their splashings.
Only Lance availed himself of tub and soap and
clean towels, and shaved every morning before
breakfast.</p>
<p>She heard him moving about in his room, heard
him go into the kitchen and ask Riley what the
chances were for something to eat. She did not
follow him, but she waited, expecting that he would
come into the living room afterwards. She went
to the piano and drummed a few bars of a new
dance hit Lance had brought home for her, and
with her head turned sidewise listened to the sound
of his footsteps in the next room, his occasional,
pleasantly throaty tones answering Riley&#8217;s high-pitched,
nasal twang.</p>
<p>Her eyes blurred with unreasoning tears. He
was her youngest. He was so big, so handsome,
so like Tom,&ndash;&ndash;yet so different! She did not believe
that Tom could really see anything to cavil
at in Lance&#8217;s presence, in his changed personality.
Tom, she thought, was secretly as proud of Lance
as she was, and only pretended to sneer at him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
hide that pride. The constraint would soon wear
off, and Lance would be one of the boys again.</p>
<p>The screen door slammed. With a lump in her
throat, Belle went to a window and looked out.
Lance, in his new Stetson and a fresh shirt and
gray trousers tucked into his riding boots, was on
his way to the stable again. She watched him pick
up a rope and go into the far corral where a few
extra saddle horses dozed through the hot afternoon.
She saw him return, leading a chunky little
roan. Saw him throw his saddle on the horse.
Saw him ride off&ndash;&ndash;the handsomest young fellow
in all the Black Rim&ndash;&ndash;but with apparently never
a thought that his mother might like a word with
him, since he had been gone for two days without
any explanation or any excuse. Which was not
like Lance, who had always before remembered to
be nice to Belle.</p>
<p>Up the Slide trail Lance rode, perhaps two hours
behind Tom. The marks of Coaley&#8217;s hoofs were
still fresh in the trail, but Lance did not appear to
see them at all. He let the roan scramble over the
shale as he would, let him take his own pace
among the boulders and up through the Slide.
At the top he put him into an easy lope which did
not slacken until he reached the descent on the
other side of the Ridge.</p>
<p>Presently, because the roan was an ambitious
young horse and eager to reach the end of the
trail, and Lance was too preoccupied to care what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
pace he traveled, they arrived at Cottonwood
Spring, circled the wire fence and whipped in
through the open gate at a gallop.</p>
<p>The little schoolhouse was deserted. Lance dismounted
and looked in, saw it still dismal with the
disorder of the last unfortunate dance. It was
evident that there had been no school since the
Fourth of July.</p>
<p>Then he remembered that Mary Hope&#8217;s father
had been sick all of the week, and it was now only
two days since the funeral. She would not be
teaching school so soon after his death.</p>
<p>He closed the door and remounted, his face
somber. He had wanted to see Mary Hope.
Since the morning after Scotty died he had fought
a vague, disquieting sense of her need of him.
There had been times when it seemed almost as
though she had called to him across the distance;
that she wished to see him. To-day he had obeyed
the wordless call. He still felt her need of him,
but since she was not at the school he hesitated.
The schoolhouse was in a measure neutral ground.
Riding over to the Douglas ranch was another
matter entirely. Too keenly had he felt the cold
animosity of Mother Douglas, the wild, impotent
hate of old Scotty mouthing threats and accusations
and vague prophecies of future disaster to
the Lorrigans. He rode slowly out through the
gate and took the trail made by the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
team when they hauled down the materials for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
schoolhouse. The chunky roan climbed briskly,
contentedly rolling the cricket in his bit. The
little burring sound of it fitted itself somehow to
the thought reiterating through Lance&#8217;s tired
brain. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t want me&ndash;&ndash;to come. She
wouldn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;want me&ndash;&ndash;to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roan squatted and ducked sidewise, and
Lance raised his head. Down the rough trail rode
a big cowpuncher with sun-reddened face and an
air of great weariness. His horse plodded wearily,
thin-flanked, his black hair sweat-roughened
and dingy. The rider looked at Lance with red-veined
eyes, the inflamed lids showing sleepless
nights.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;r yuh?&#8221; he greeted perfunctorily, as they
passed each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; said Lance imperturbably, and rode
on.</p>
<p>Lance&#8217;s eyebrows pulled together. He had no
need of looking back; he had seen a great deal in
the one glance he had given the stranger. He
scrutinized the trail, measured with his eyes the
size and the shape of the horse&#8217;s footprints.</p>
<p>After a little he left the wagon road and put the
roan to the steep climb up the trail to the great
Tooth of the ridge. He still frowned, still rode
with bent head, his eyes on the trail. But now he
was alert, conscious of his surroundings, thinking
of every yard of ground they covered.</p>
<p>At a little distance from the base of the Tooth he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
dismounted, tying the restive roan to a bush to
prevent him from wandering around, nibbling investigatingly
at weeds, bushes, all the things that
interest a young horse.</p>
<p>Slowly, walking carefully on rocks, Lance approached
the Tooth. A new look was in his face
now,&ndash;&ndash;a look half tender, half angry because of
the tenderness. Several times he had met Mary
Hope here at the Tooth, when he was just a long-legged
youth with a fondness for teasing, and she
was a slim, wide-eyed little thing in short skirts
and sunbonnet. Always the meetings had pretended
to be accidental, and always Mary Hope
had seemed very much interested in the magnificent
outlook and very slightly interested in him.</p>
<p>From the signs, some one else was much interested
in the view. Lance came upon a place where
a man had slipped with one foot and left the deep
mark of his boot in the loose, gravelly soil. Sitting
on a boulder, he made a leisurely survey of the
place and counted three cigarette stubs that had
fallen short of the crevice toward which they had
evidently been flung. How many had gone into
the crevice he could not tell. He slid off the
boulder and, walking on a rock shelf that jutted out
from the huge upthrust rock, examined the place
very thoroughly.</p>
<p>At a certain spot where Mary Hope had been
fond of sitting on the rock shelf with her straight
little back against the Tooth&#8217;s smooth side, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
splendid view of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch was to be
had. The house itself was hidden in a cottonwood
grove that Belle had planted when she was a bride,
but the corrals, the pastures, the road up the Ridge
was plainly visible. And in the shallow crack in
the rock was another cigarette end, economically
smoked down to a three-quarter-inch stub.</p>
<p>Lance returned by way of the shelf to the outcropping
of rocks that would leave no trace of his
passing. He untied and mounted the roan and
circled the vicinity cautiously. Two hundred
yards away, down the slope and on a small level
place where the brush grew thick, he found where
a horse had stood for hours. He looked at the
hoofprints, turned back and rode down the schoolhouse
trail again, following the tracks of the
fagged black horse.</p>
<p>When another fifty yards would bring the basin
in sight, Lance turned off the trail and dismounted,
tied the roan again and went forward slowly, his
eyes intent on the tops of the trees around Cottonwood
Spring. A rattler buzzed suddenly, and he
stopped, looked to see where the snake was coiled,
saw it withdraw its mottled gray body from under
a rabbit weed and drag sinuously away, its ugly
head lifted a little, eyes watching him venomously.
An unwritten law of the West he broke by letting
the snake go. Again he moved forward, from
bush to bush, from boulder to boulder. When all
of the basin and the grove were revealed to him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
he stopped, removed his gray range hat and hung
it on a near-by bush. He took his small field
glasses from his pocket, dusted the lenses deliberately
and, leaning forward across a rock with his
elbows steadied on the stone and the glasses to
his eyes, he swept foot by foot the grove.</p>
<p>He was some minutes in discovering a black
horse well within the outer fringe of the cottonwoods,
switching mechanically at the flies and mosquitoes
that infested the place, and throwing his
head impatiently to his side now and then when the
sting was too sharp to ignore. With the glasses
he could see the sweat-roughened hide ripple convulsively
to dislodge the pestering insects, could
see the flaring nostrils as the horse blew out the
dust gathered from his hungry nosing amongst
the coarse grass and weeds. The man Lance did
not at once discover, but after a little he saw him
rolled in canvas to protect himself from the mosquitoes.
He seemed already fast asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;He needs it,&#8221; said Lance grimly, with his
twisted smile, and went back to the roan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h2>
<h3>LANCE PLAYS THE GAME</h3>
</div>
<p>That night Lance sauntered into the bunk
house, placidly ignoring the fact that Tom
was there, and that some sort of intermittent conference
was taking place. Cool and clean and silk-shirted
and freshly shaved, the contrast was sharp
between him and the men sprawled on their beds
or sitting listlessly around the table playing keno.
Tom lifted an eyebrow at him; Lance sent him a
look to match and went over to the card players.</p>
<p>They did not want him in the bunk house. He
who had spent nearly all of his life on the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth ranch knew that he was not wanted. They
did not want him to know that he was not wanted,
and by their very effort to hide it did they betray
themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t go to Jumpoff after all, dad,&#8221; Lance
remarked idly, a rising inflection turning the
phrase into a question.</p>
<p>Tom grunted and got up to go. His men cast
furtive glances at one another, looked at Lance
from under their brows, noted the silk shirt and
the low, tan Oxfords, and the texture and cut of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
his gray trousers with the tan leather belt that had
a small silver buckle. Plain as it was they knew
that buckle was silver. They saw how clean-cut
was the hairline at the back of his head and over
his ears&ndash;&ndash;sure sign that he was &#8220;citified.&#8221; And
toward the man who is citified your purely range-bred
product cherishes a distinct if secret grudge.
His immaculate presence made them all feel
frowsy and unwashed and ill-clad. And to hide
how conscious he was of his own deficiencies, the
man who sat nearest Lance lifted his hat and
rumpled his hair still more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duke and Al didn&#8217;t get in yet, eh?&#8221; Lance
picked up an extra deck of cards and began to
shuffle them absent-mindedly but nevertheless dexterously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope&ndash;&ndash;they stayed out,&#8221; replied a blond man
named Winters. They called him &#8220;Chilly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot weather for working cattle,&#8221; Lance observed
indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&ndash;&ndash;sure is,&#8221; responded Ed Moran, who
was low-browed and dark and had an ugly jaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&ndash;&ndash;<i>damn</i> hot,&#8221; testified Jim Bloom.
&#8220;How&#8217;s Californy for weather?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh-h&ndash;&ndash;it has all kinds, same as here.&#8221; Lance
did not want to talk about California just then,
but he followed the lead easily enough. &#8220;You can
get anything you want in California. In two
hours you can go from twenty-five feet of snow
to orange groves. You can have it all green, fruit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
trees and roses blooming in midwinter, or you can
hit into desert worse than anything Idaho can
show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s right, all right. Great place,
Californy,&#8221; Chilly tried to make his voice sound
enthusiastic, and failed. &#8220;Great place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking about climate&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Lance sat down
on a corner of the table, eased his trousers over
his knees, crossed his tan Oxfords and began a
story. It was a long story, and for some time it
was not at all apparent that he was getting anywhere
with it. He shuffled the deck of cards while
he talked, and the keno game, interrupted when he
began, trailed off into &#8220;Who&#8217;s play is it?&#8221; and
finally ceased altogether. That was when Lance&#8217;s
Jewish dialect began to be funny enough to make
even Chilly Winters laugh. At the end there was
a general cachinnation.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s only a sample of the stuff they pull
out there, on tourists,&#8221; said Lance, when the
laughter had subsided to a few belated chuckles.
&#8220;There&#8217;s another one. It isn&#8217;t funny&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m
going to <i>make</i> it funny. You&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s funny&ndash;&ndash;but
it isn&#8217;t, really.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told that one and made them think it was
funny. At least they laughed, and laughed again
when he had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now here&#8217;s another. This one really is funny&ndash;&ndash;but
you won&#8217;t feel like laughing at it. I&#8217;ll tell
it so you won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>He told that story and saw it fall flat. &#8220;You
see?&#8221; He flipped the cards, tossed them on the
table with a whimsical gesture. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t what
you do in this world&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s how you do it that
counts. I&#8217;m sitting on your keno game, am I?
All right, I&#8217;ll get off.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went out as abruptly as he had entered, and
he paused long enough outside to know that a
silence marked his going. Then he heard Ed
Koran&#8217;s voice depreciating him. Frankly he listened,
lighting a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw&ndash;&ndash;his mother was an actress, wasn&#8217;t she?
<i>That</i> guy ain&#8217;t going to cut no ice around here
whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks an awful darn lot like Tom,&#8221; ventured
Chilly. &#8220;I dunno&ndash;&ndash;you take a Lorrigan&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him? Lorrigan? Why, say! He may <i>look</i>
like a Lorrigan, but he ain&#8217;t one. Tom&#8217;s damn
right. He don&#8217;t set in. Why, like as not he&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, cut out the gabbling!&#8221; Ed&#8217;s voice
growled again. &#8220;It&#8217;s yore play, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stepping softly, Lance went on to the house.
&#8220;I just&ndash;&ndash;<i>look</i> like one!&#8221; he repeated under his
breath. &#8220;Fine! At any rate,&#8221; he added dryly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve proved that I <i>can</i> go into the bunk house
now and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went up and sang songs with Belle then,
until after ten o&#8217;clock. He would have sung
longer, but it happened that in the middle of a
particularly pleasing &#8220;Ah-<i>ee</i>, oh-<i>ee</i>, hush-a-bye-<i>ba-by</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
yodel, Tom put his head out of the bedroom
and implored Lance to for-the-Lord-sake go
up on the Ridge to howl. So Lance forbore to
finish the &#8220;ah-<i>ee</i>, oh-<i>ee</i>,&#8221; much to Belle&#8217;s disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know Tom&#8217;s been out riding hard and
not getting much sleep, so I guess maybe we better
cut out the concert, honey,&#8221; she told Lance, getting
up and laying her plump, brown arms across his
shoulders. &#8220;My heavens, Lance, you kinda make
me think the clock&#8217;s set back thirty years, when I
look at you. You&#8217;re Tom, all over&ndash;&ndash;and I did
think you were going to be like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance scowled just a little. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not Tom
all over&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m Lance all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Lorrigan all over,&#8221; Belle persisted.
&#8220;And you&#8217;re just like Tom when he was your age.
Good Lord, how time does slip away! Tom used
to be so full of fun and say such funny things&ndash;&ndash;and
now it&#8217;s just ride and ride and work, and eat
and sleep. Honey, I want you to know that I&#8217;m
glad you learned something a little different.
What&#8217;s the use of having a million, if you work
yourself to death getting it? Look at the boys&ndash;&ndash;look
at Al and Duke. They&#8217;re like old men, the
last year or two. We used to have such good times
on the ranch, but we don&#8217;t any more&ndash;&ndash;nobody
ever thinks of anything but work.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lowered her voice to a whisper, her arms
still lying on Lance&#8217;s shoulders, her clouded blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
eyes looking up into his. &#8220;That trouble with
Scotty Douglas kind of&ndash;&ndash;changed Tom and the
boys. You went away. You&#8217;ve changed too, but
in a different way. It <i>soured</i> them, just a little.
Tom wants to make his million quick and get outa
here. I was glad when you stirred things up a
little, last spring, and gave that dance. Or I was
glad, till it ended up the way it did. It was the
first dance we&#8217;d been to since you left, Lance!
And I thought it would kind of patch up a little
more friendliness with the folks around here. But
it didn&#8217;t. It just made a lot of talk and trouble&ndash;&ndash;and,
Lance, honey, I&#8217;m awfully darn sorry about
that piano. It&#8217;s down in the chicken house this
minute. Tom wouldn&#8217;t even have it in the house.
And now, I don&#8217;t suppose there ever will be any
chance to make friends with any one. Tom&ndash;&ndash;well,
all of us were so <i>darn</i> mad to think she never
even asked us&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care any more about that, Belle. Please
don&#8217;t. And by the way, I took the money Mary
Hope wanted to give dad for the schoolhouse.
Perhaps he didn&#8217;t tell you, but he threatened to
burn the house down if she left the money, so I
took it and gave her a bill of sale in his name. I
wish you&#8217;d keep the money. And some day, maybe
dad will take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom never told me a word about it,&#8221; Belle
whispered pitifully, dropping her forehead on
Lance&#8217;s broad chest. &#8220;Honey, it never used to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
this way. He used to tell me things. But now,
he doesn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;much. Last spring, when he built
the schoolhouse and all, I was so <i>glad!</i> It was more
like old times, and I thought&ndash;&ndash;but the fight turned
him and the boys again, and now they&#8217;re just as
far off as ever. Lance, I don&#8217;t whine. You never
heard Belle whine in your life, did you, honey?
But I&#8217;ll tell you this: The only things that
haven&#8217;t changed, on the Devil&#8217;s Tooth, are Riley
and the pintos. And even they let you drive &#8217;em
to Jumpoff and back last spring without busting
things up. They&#8217;re getting old, I guess. Maybe
we&#8217;re all getting old. Still, Rosa and Subrosa
are only ten past, and I haven&#8217;t had a birthday for
years&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;Lance, do you mind if Belle lets go and
tells you things, just this once? You&#8217;ve changed,
some, but not like the rest. Please, Lance, I want
to lean against you and&ndash;&ndash;and feel how strong
you are&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A great tenderness, a great, overwhelming desire
to comfort his mother, who had never let him
call her mother, seized Lance. His arms closed
around her and he backed to an armchair and sat
down on it, holding her close.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care, Belle&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s all right. It&#8217;s <i>going</i>
to be all right. I&#8217;m just Lance, but I&#8217;m a man&ndash;&ndash;and
men were made to take care of their women.
Talk to me&ndash;&ndash;tell me what&#8217;s been eating your heart
out, lately. It&#8217;s in your eyes. I saw it when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
came home last spring, and I see it now every time
I look at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen it, honey?&#8221; Belle&#8217;s whisper was
against his ear. She did not look at his face.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to see, but&ndash;&ndash;one feels it.
Tom&#8217;s good to me&ndash;&ndash;but he isn&#8217;t <i>close</i> to me, any
more. The boys are good to me&ndash;&ndash;but they&#8217;re like
strangers. They don&#8217;t talk about things, the way
they used to do. They come and go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance&#8217;s big, well-kept hand went up to smooth
her hair with a comforting, caressing movement
infinitely sweet to Belle. &#8220;I know,&#8221; he said
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it isn&#8217;t anything, of course. But the old
boys have gone, and these new ones&ndash;&ndash;Lance, what
is the matter with the Devil&#8217;s Tooth ranch? Tell
me, for heaven&#8217;s sake, if I&#8217;m getting to be an old
woman with notions!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never be an old woman,&#8221; said Lance in
the tone Mary Hope built her day-dreams around.
&#8220;Age has nothing to do with you&ndash;&ndash;you just <i>are</i>.
But as to notions&ndash;&ndash;well, you may have. Women
do have them, I believe.&#8221; He kissed her hair and
added, &#8220;What do you think is the matter with the
ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t <i>know</i>. When I try to pin it to one
thing, there&#8217;s nothing to put a pin in. Not a thing.
You remember Cheyenne? I was afraid Tom
would kill him, after the trial. You know it was
practically proven that he was a spy, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
working to get something on the outfit. I was on
the warpath myself, over that trial. I would a shot
up a few in that courtroom if Tom had been convicted.
You know and I know that Tom didn&#8217;t
have a thing to do with that darned, spotted yearling
of Scotty&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Cheyenne just&ndash;&ndash;just faded out of existence.
Tom&#8217;s never mentioned him from the day of
the trial to this. And I know he hates the whole Rim,
and won&#8217;t have anything much to do with anybody&ndash;&ndash;but
he acts just as if nothing had happened, as
if nobody had ever tried to make him out a cow thief.
He won&#8217;t talk about it. He won&#8217;t talk
about anything much. When we&#8217;re alone he just
sits and <i>thinks</i>. And honey, the Lorrigans have
always been men that <i>did</i> things.</p>
<p>&#8220;He and the boys woke up, and the ranch acted
human about the schoolhouse, but it&#8217;s other times,
when there&#8217;s no excitement around, that I feel as
if&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know what. It&#8217;s something underneath.
Something that never comes to the top.
Something that&#8217;s liable to reach up and grab.&#8221;
She put a hand up and patted Lance&#8217;s lean, hard
jaw. &#8220;I&#8217;d shoot any one that said Belle Lorrigan&#8217;s
<i>afraid</i>&ndash;&ndash;but that&#8217;s about what it amounts
to,&#8221; she finished with a little mirthless laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Belle Lorrigan&#8217;s not afraid. There&#8217;s nothing
to be afraid of. You&#8217;ve lived in the Rim too long,
Belle, and you&#8217;ve been watching dad and the boys
chasing that million. I&#8217;ve seen other men working
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
at it, and it always gets hold of them until they
don&#8217;t seem to care for anything else. Now, I
know an ageless lady who&#8217;s going to bed and forget
all about her nerves and her notions. Or if
she doesn&#8217;t forget, she&#8217;ll remember too that she
has somebody around who knows&ndash;&ndash;and who cares
a heap for his mother.&#8221; Lance pulled her close
and kissed her comfortingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That helps,&#8221; whispered Belle. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
changed, too&ndash;&ndash;but not like the rest, thank God.
And I thought maybe you had noticed things&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noticed that the Devil&#8217;s Tooth is mighty
busy chasing dollars on the hoof,&#8221; soothed Lance.
&#8220;It has left our Belle alone too much, and it has
gotten on her nerves. Go to bed, woman&ndash;&ndash;and
dream of pleasant things.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her by the shoulders and pushed her
playfully to the very door of her bedroom, gave
her another kiss and turned the knob for her, and
watched her go in with a smile on her face. His
own smile lasted only until the door was closed.
He went to the lamp, blew it out and entered
his own room, removed his shoes and dropped
them on the floor with more noise than was
considerate of his father&#8217;s slumber, lighted his
lamp and moved aimlessly about the room for a
time.</p>
<p>He sat down on the edge of the bed while he
smoked a cigarette, his elbows on his knees, his
thoughts traveling far trails. Abruptly he rose,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
put on a pair of well-worn tennis shoes, opened a
door leading outside and went quietly down to the
corrals.</p>
<p>The first corral he crossed and found it empty of
any horses save the pintos and Coaley. The second
corral held three horses, one of them the
chunky roan he had ridden that afternoon. The
third and largest corral was empty, the gate
swinging open.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&ndash;&ndash;no horses caught up for night-riding&ndash;&ndash;<i>yet</i>,&#8221;
he said to himself, and returned
to the house, leaving the straighter path to pass
close to the bunk house. He listened there for a
full two minutes, decided that it would take at least
five men to do all of that snoring, and went to bed
thankful for the comfort of a felt mattress under
his tired body.</p>
<p>The next day passed without any incidents save
trivial ones that did not count. Lance rode to
the creek with his trout-rod and reel&ndash;&ndash;more citified
innovations which the ranch eyed askance&ndash;&ndash;and
spent four hours loitering along the bank, his
fly floating uselessly over shallow pools where was
never a fish. It was not the right time of day for
fishing, but Lance seemed to have forgotten the
lore he had learned along that same creek and
others farther away.</p>
<p>Sometimes he could be seen from the ranch
buildings, more often he could not. When he
could not be seen was when he was crouched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
among the rocks, studying the Devil&#8217;s Tooth Ridge
with his powerful glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope he&#8217;s comfortable,&#8221; he said once, when,
satisfied that his guess was correct, he put the
glasses away and settled down seriously to fishing.</p>
<p>He rode home with four trout, and Riley fried
them for supper. During supper Lance criticized
Squaw Creek, and hinted that Mill Creek and Lava
Creek were better fishing waters, and that he
meant to try them.</p>
<p>That night at eleven o&#8217;clock he made another
silent tour of the corrals and went to bed feeling
pretty sure that the ranch would show its present
complement of men in the morning.</p>
<p>On the second day, four of the hired cowboys
rode in at sundown, and with them came Al. Their
horses were fagged. They themselves were dirty,
hungry, tired. Their faces were glum&ndash;&ndash;and the
glumness remained even after they had washed
and eaten ravenously. Al did not come to the
house at all, but stayed down in the bunk house,
whither Tom presently went. Lance did not follow.</p>
<p>Belle looked worried and asked Lance constrainedly
if he knew why Duke had not come with
the others. Lance laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duke? Oh&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s on the trail of another dollar.
By heck, Belle, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve raised one
son to be a shirk. I don&#8217;t seem to need all of that
dollar chasing to make me happy.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>Tom came in then, glanced swiftly from one to
the other, said something unimportant, rolled a
cigarette with elaborate care, and observed that
Duke would find it hot, riding all the way to Shoshone,
and that he&#8217;d be darned if he&#8217;d go that far
for any girl. He sat down and disposed himself
comfortably, got up, muttered something about
forgetting to turn Coaley out, and left the house.</p>
<p>Belle turned and looked at Lance. &#8220;Honey,
it&#8217;s that kind of thing&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to think, Belle, that you had the bluest
eyes in the whole world,&#8221; Lance drawled quizzically.
&#8220;They&#8217;re blue enough, in all conscience&ndash;&ndash;by
heck, Belle! Does a Lorrigan always love blue
eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to say that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were going to say that you were not going
to say a darned thing, madam. You need a vacation,
a trip somewhere. Why don&#8217;t you beat it,
and get your nerves smoothed down a little?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance, you don&#8217;t believe Duke&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Belle, your boys are old enough to think of
girls a little bit, now and then. Even your baby
thinks of girls&ndash;&ndash;a little bit. Now and then. I&#8217;m
going fishing, Belle. I&#8217;m going to fish where there
are fish. And if I&#8217;m not back by the clock, for
heck&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t get yourself excited and call <i>me</i>
a mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>She called after him. &#8220;Lance, come back here
and tell me the truth! You don&#8217;t believe&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Belle, I&#8217;ll tell you the truth. Sure, I&#8217;ll tell you
the truth. I tell you to cut out this worrying over
nothing. Why, don&#8217;t you know the world is
plumb full of real things to worry about?&#8221; He
came close, patting her on the shoulder as one pats
a child who feels abused for slight cause. &#8220;This
notion of yours&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s all damned nonsense. Cut
it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went off whistling, and Belle gazed after him
dubiously, yet reassured in spite of herself. After
all, there was nothing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h2>
<h3>WHEN A LORRIGAN LOVES</h3>
</div>
<p>Followed a day of sweltering heat, when the
horses in the corral switched flies and sweated
doing nothing; when all of the chickens crawled
under the coolest shelter they could find, and
panted with their wings spread away from their
bodies; when the wind was like a blast from an
open furnace, and no man of his own choice remained
in the sun.</p>
<p>In the shade of the biggest haystack, Tom and
Al squatted on their boot heels with their faces
toward the corral and the houses beyond, and
talked for two hours in low monotones while they
broke spears of fragrant hay into tiny bits and
snapped the bits from them with thumb and finger.
From the house porch Lance saw them there and
wondered what they were talking about so long.
He even meditated committing the crime of eavesdropping,
but he decided against it. Even if there
had been any point from which he could approach
the two unseen, his soul rebelled against such tactics
employed in cold blood.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>Devil&#8217;s Tooth Ranch dragged somehow through
its third day of inaction, and that night prepared
itself to sleep if possible, though the hot wind still
blew half a gale and the sky was too murky to
show any stars.</p>
<p>Daylight found Lance awake and brooding as
he had done ever since his return. He heard no
sound in the house, and after a while he dressed
and went down to the bunk house. It was empty.
No extra horses had been corralled the night before,
of that he was sure. Yet the boys were gone
again, and with them had gone Tom and Al. He
looked and saw Coaley in the box stall.</p>
<p>On this morning Lance asked no questions of
Sam Pretty Cow or Shorty, who presently appeared
and went listlessly about their tasks. He
returned to the house, heard Riley grinding coffee,
and dressed for riding while he waited for breakfast.
He was drinking his first cup of coffee when
Belle appeared in a thin blue kimono and a lacey
breakfast cap which Lance knew had been ordered
from the big, dog-eared catalogue on the living room
table. He roused himself from scowling
meditation and gave her a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; sighed Belle. &#8220;Tom&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; she
stopped and looked at Lance hesitatingly. &#8220;Tom
had to push the cattle back from Lava Bed way&ndash;&ndash;he
says this weather&#8217;s drying up Lava Creek and
the stock&#8217;ll suffer if they&#8217;re left drifting up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
down the mud-holes where they&#8217;ve watered all
summer. He took the boys and started about
two in the morning&ndash;&ndash;to get out of the heat. I&ndash;&ndash;I
didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d want to go, honey&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You thought right. I didn&#8217;t want to go; it&#8217;s
too hot,&#8221; Lance assured her, and refrained from
looking at her face and the pathetic cheerfulness
she was trying so hard to make real.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sultry. I thought yesterday I couldn&#8217;t
stand another hour of that wind&ndash;&ndash;but now I wish
it would blow. It&#8217;s going to storm&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s going to storm.&#8221; Lance set down
his empty cup. &#8220;I may go fishing, Belle. Don&#8217;t
look for me back&ndash;&ndash;I may ride over and see how
the AJ is making out. The little Boyle girl is not
married yet, I hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;no. No, she isn&#8217;t. Lance, honey&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance waited beside her chair, but Belle seemed
to forget that she had anything to say. She sat
leaning her head on one hand, the other stirring
her coffee absent-mindedly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get caught
out,&#8221; she said apathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221; Lance lifted the lace frill of the cap
and kissed her temple lightly. &#8220;Go back to bed.
It&#8217;s too early for you to be up.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the stable Sam Pretty Cow looked a question,
grunted and went on with his stall cleaning.
Lance saddled Coaley, tied on an emergency ration
of grub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fishin&#8217;s good t&#8217;day. Storm&#8217;s coming. Uh-huh&ndash;&ndash;you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
bet,&#8221; Sam Pretty Cow observed as
Lance mounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; Lance assented non-committally and
rode away.</p>
<p>There were no horse tracks in the trail, yet
Lance followed it doggedly, the new-risen sun
burning his back through two thin shirts. He
seemed in no doubt this morning as to the course
he should take. He scarcely gave a glance at the
trail. His eyes were staring straight before him
at a sullen row of blue-black &#8220;thunder heads&#8221;
that showed above the gray skyline. Yet he did
not see them, did not give a thought to their meaning.</p>
<p>He was thinking poignantly of Mary Hope,
fighting the vivid impression which a dream last
night had left with him. In his dream Mary Hope
had stood at her door, with her hands held out to
him beseechingly, and called and called: &#8220;Lance!
Oh, Lance! I dinna hate you because you&#8217;re a
Lorrigan&ndash;&ndash;Oh, <i>Lance!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>It had been a curious dream from start to finish.
Curious because, in various forms, this was the
third time he had seen her stand with hands outstretched,
calling to him. He did not believe in
dreams. He had neither patience for presentiments
nor faith in anything that bordered on the
occult.</p>
<p>It had been against much inner protest that he
had ridden to the schoolhouse in obedience to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
persistent idea that she needed him. That he had
not found her there seemed to him conclusive
proof that there was nothing in telepathy. The
dreams, he felt sure, were merely a continuation
of that persistent idea&ndash;&ndash;and the persistent idea,
he was beginning to believe, was but a perverse
twist given to his own longing for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;And I can&#8217;t go to her&ndash;&ndash;not yet. Not while
the Lorrigan name&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; What came before, what
came after those incomplete phrases he would not
permit his mind to formulate in words. But he
could not shake off the effect of the dream, could
not stifle altogether the impulse that plucked at
his resolve.</p>
<p>For more than an hour he rode and tried to fix
his mind upon the thing he had set out to do. He
knew perfectly well where he was going&ndash;&ndash;and it
was <i>not</i> to see Mary Hope. Neither was his destination
Lava Creek nor the drying range on either
side. His first two days of hard riding had been
not altogether fruitless, and he had enough to
think of without thinking of Mary Hope. Certain
cold facts stared at him, and gibbered their sinister
meaning, and dared him to ride on and discover
other facts, blood-brothers of these that
haunted him o&#8217; nights.</p>
<p>Coaley, feeling his rider&#8217;s mood, sensing also
the portent of the heavy, heat-saturated atmosphere
and the rolling thunder heads, slowed his
springy trot to a walk and tossed his head uneasily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
from side to side. Then, quite without warning,
Lance wheeled the horse short around and touched
the reeking flanks with his heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m seventeen kinds of a damn fool&ndash;&ndash;but I
can&#8217;t stand any more of this!&#8221; he muttered savagely,
and rode at a sharp trot with his back to the
slow-gathering storm.</p>
<p>He found Mary Hope half a mile from the Douglas
house, at the edge of the meadow round which
Hugh was driving a mower, the steady, metallic
clicking of the shuttle-like sickle sounding distinct
from the farther side of the motionless green expanse.
Mary Hope was standing leaning against
one lone little poplar tree, her hat in her hand, and
her eyes staring dully into the world of sorrowful
thoughts. Relief and a great, hungry tenderness
flooded the soul of Lance when he saw her. He
pulled up and swung off beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl&ndash;&ndash;thank the good God you&#8217;re all right,&#8221;
he said, and took her in his arms, the veins on his
temples beating full with his hot blood. &#8220;I had to
come. I had to see you. You&#8217;ve haunted me.
Your voice has called me&ndash;&ndash;I was afraid&ndash;&ndash;I had
to come&ndash;&ndash;and now I&#8217;m not going to let you go.
Oh, girl, you&#8217;re mine! By all the powers of
heaven and earth, you&#8217;re mine! The Lorrigan name&ndash;&ndash;what
does it matter? You&#8217;re mine&ndash;&ndash;I love
you. You&#8217;ll love me. I&#8217;ll <i>make</i> you love me.
You&#8217;ll love me till you won&#8217;t care who I am or who
you are, or whether there are any other people in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
the world&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll love me so! And I&#8217;ll love you
always, always,&ndash;&ndash;to death and beyond, and beyond
what lies after that. Girl, girl&ndash;&ndash;you do
need me! You need my love. You need it because
it&#8217;s the biggest thing in the world&ndash;&ndash;and
your love is going to match it. We&#8217;ll get married&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll
make a world of our own, just you and I.
We won&#8217;t care where we make it&ndash;&ndash;it will be our
world, the world of our love. Are you game?
Are you game to love Lance the way Lance loves
you? Oh, girl, tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>A chill breath swept them like the memory of her
father&#8217;s hate. A deep, basso rumble drowned
whatever reply she stammered. He sheltered her
in his arms, kissed her lips, her eyes, her hair,
went back to her lips again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, girl&ndash;&ndash;when a Lorrigan loves&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; He
cried softly, exultantly. &#8220;I tried not to&ndash;&ndash;but I
had to love you. It&#8217;s Fate. Are you afraid to
love me back? Are you afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No Lorrigan can cry coward to a Douglas,&#8221;
Mary Hope panted. &#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;but my mother will
be that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother will be that&ndash;&ndash;all of that, and
more,&#8221; Lance stopped her, still exulting in her
love. &#8220;All the Lorrigans&ndash;&ndash;what does it matter?
Life&#8217;s for you and me to live, you girl with the
bluest eyes in the world. When will you marry
me? To-day? Tell me to-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Mary Hope, breathless still from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
the suddenness of it all. &#8220;Oh, not to-day&ndash;&ndash;oh,
but the headlong way you have! I&ndash;&ndash;I canna
think. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to think. I didn&#8217;t ask you to
think. Just love me&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s all. And marry me
soon, Girl-with-the-blue-eyes. Soon. It must be
soon&ndash;&ndash;sooner than to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Splittingly the thunder crashed close behind
them, a vivid white line cleaving sharply the snarling
clouds. Like a sleeper Lance opened the
eyes he had closed against her hair and lifted his
head. &#8220;I must take you home,&#8221; he said more
calmly. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to storm&ndash;&ndash;hard. But let
me tell you, sweetheart,&ndash;&ndash;it can&#8217;t storm as hard
as I can love. I&#8217;ll take you home, and then you&#8217;ll
marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope&#8217;s face was pale and radiant. She
did not say that she would marry him&ndash;&ndash;nor did
she say that she would not. Her eyes were misty
with tears until she winked hard, when they shone
softly. Lance had never seen them so blue. She
stood still, her hands clasped together tightly
while he gathered up the reins and mounted. He
pulled his foot from the left stirrup, reached down
to her and smiled. Never had she seen him smile
like that. Never had she seen that look in his eyes.
She breathed deep, reached up and caught the
saddle horn, put her foot in the stirrup and let
him lift her beside him.</p>
<p>Against Coaley&#8217;s nervous pull at the bit Lance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
held a steadying hand and laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s Fate,
girl. Let the storm come. We&#8217;ll beat it&ndash;&ndash;it
can&#8217;t hurt us. Nothing can hurt us now.&#8221; He
had to shout above the crashing thunder. &#8220;Do
you love me, sweetheart?&#8221; His eyes, close to her
own, flamed softly, making Mary Hope think dizzily
of altar fires.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do&ndash;&ndash;I do!&#8221; She gasped. &#8220;Oh, I cannot
think how I love you&ndash;&ndash;it scares me to think!&#8221;
Her arm was around his neck, her face was turned
to his.</p>
<p>He saw her lips form the words, guessed what
it was she was saying. The crash on crash of
thunder beat the sound of her voice to nothingness.
The white glare of the lightning flashes blinded
them. Coaley, quivering, his nostrils belling until
they showed all red within, his big eyes staring,
forged ahead, fighting the bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s rinning away wi&#8217; us!&#8221; shouted Lance, his
lips close to her ear, and laughed boyishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he heard her say, and pulled her
higher in his arms, so that he could be sure that
she heard him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just pick your little old mother up in my
arms and make her love me, too!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Nothing can spoil our love&ndash;&ndash;<i>nothing!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>As though the gods themselves chided his temerity,
the very heavens split and shattered all
sound with rending uproar. Coaley squatted,
stopped and stood shaking, his heart pounding so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
that Lance felt its tremulous tattoo against his
thigh. The rumbling after-note of the thunder
seemed like silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It struck close. That shed&ndash;&ndash;look!&#8221; Lance&#8217;s
voice was no longer the voice of the young male
whose love would override Fate itself. It was
the voice of the man who will meet emergencies
quietly, unflinchingly, and soothe the woman&#8217;s
fear. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s all right, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>
<p>He forced Coaley to go on. He smiled at Mary
Hope&#8217;s pallor, he reassured her as they neared her
home. A shed, sufficiently detached to keep its
fire to itself, was blazing. The wind puffed suddenly
from nowhere and waved the high, yellow
flames like torn ribbons. Great globules of water
splashed upon them from the pent torrent above.
Coaley galloped through the gate, passed the house,
shied at something lying on the ground, stopped
abruptly when Lance pulled sharply on the bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl&ndash;&ndash;sweetheart&ndash;&ndash;<i>be game!</i>&#8221; Lance said
sternly when Mary Hope screamed.</p>
<p>He let her to the ground, swung off and passed
her, running to the pitifully still little figure of
Mother Douglas lying in the pathway, her checked
apron flapping, its starchy stiffness showing limp
dark spots where the raindrops splashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s only shocked. She&#8217;s all right&ndash;&ndash;<i>stop
that screaming!</i> Good God, girl, where&#8217;s your
nerve?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>His severity steadied her. Mary Hope stopped
screaming, both hands held tightly over her mouth.
Lance was already on his way to the house, carrying
Mother Douglas like a sleeping child in his
arms. And the rain came, a white curtain of
water that drenched them to the skin in the first
ten seconds.</p>
<p>On the bed where Aleck Douglas had stared at
the ceiling, and raved, and died, Lance laid her
carefully as though he feared to waken her. He
tore open the faded calico dress at the throat, laid
his ear upon her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s alive, sweetheart,&#8221; he said hearteningly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s only a shock. Bring a basin of water.
We&#8217;ll have her all right in no time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He worked over the old woman, using all the
means he could remember or invent, while the
house shook with the fury of the wind, and the
lightning dazzled them and the rain drummed incessantly
on the roof. Mary Hope watched him,
her eyes wide, her lips refusing to form any words.
For her own sake he sent her on many little errands,
kept her busy at useless little tasks. After
what seemed an interminable time he stood looking
down at the gently heaving breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;How game is my girl?&#8221; he asked, taking Mary
Hope in his arms. &#8220;Is she game enough to stay
here while Lance goes for a doctor? It won&#8217;t be
long&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He paused while he made a rapid
mental calculation of the distance, and of what a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
horse may endure. &#8220;Three hours. Will my girl
be brave enough to stay here three hours? I&#8217;ll
call the man who was mowing&ndash;&ndash;if I can find him.
But that will take minutes. Three hours&ndash;&ndash;and
you won&#8217;t weaken, will you, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary Hope leaned against him, clutched him,
shivered at the crashing thunder. &#8220;It&#8217;s awful,&#8221;
she moaned. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you might be hit&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid? A Douglas not as game as a Lorrigan?&#8221;
He shook her, lifted his eyebrows at her,
pursed his lips at her, shook her again and kissed
her. &#8220;I can&#8217;t love a girl who&#8217;s afraid of thunder.
Your mother&#8217;s all right, you know. We saw where
that bolt struck&ndash;&ndash;fifty yards, almost, from where
she was. She got a shock, that&#8217;s all. But we&#8217;ll
have a doctor here and make him take the responsibility.
And I&#8217;ll be back in three hours, and you&#8217;re
going to be game&ndash;&ndash;just as game as you&#8217;ve always
been.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled his hat down over his eyes, buttoned
his wet coat to the chin, laid his hand for a minute
over the faintly pulsating heart of Mother Douglas,
swept Mary Hope up in his arms and kissed
her again, pulled open the door and was gone.</p>
<p>Through a rain-blurred window Mary Hope saw
him run to the stable, lead out Coaley who had
taken refuge there, vault into the saddle without
troubling about the stirrup, and come thundering
back past the house and out of the gate, his head
bent to the storm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>She looked at the clock. Three hours? He
could never do it in three hours! She went back
and knelt beside the bed, and prayed as her mother
had taught her to pray. And not all of her petition
was for her mother. Every lightning flash,
every crack, every distant boom of the thunder
made her cringe. Lance&ndash;&ndash;Lance was out in the
storm, at the mercy of its terrible sword-thrusts
that seemed to smite even the innocent. Her
mother&ndash;&ndash;even her own mother, who had held unswervingly
to her faith&ndash;&ndash;even she had been struck
down!</p>
<p>A mile down the road Lance was leaning forward,
encouraging Coaley to more speed, because
there the trail ran level and fairly free from rocks.
Later, he pulled the horse down to a walk, breathing
him up a hill; let him trot down the slope beyond,
picked him into a swift gallop when they
again struck the level. He gauged, with coldblooded
attention to certain rough miles in the
journey, just how swiftly Coaley could cover
ground and live. He knew horses. He knew
Coaley, and he knew that never yet had Coaley
been pushed to the actual limit of his endurance.
But the girl Lance loved&ndash;&ndash;ah, it was a Lorrigan
who loved!&ndash;&ndash;was back there alone, and she would
be counting the minutes. It might be that he
might return to find her weeping over her dead.
So Lance counted miles and a horse&#8217;s strength,
and bent to the storm and rode.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>Ten minutes past the hour, and he was snapping
orders to the telegraph operator. The storm,
happily, had swept on down the canyon and had
given Jumpoff little more than a wetting and a few
lightning flashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And order out a special engine and coach,&ndash;&ndash;what
do I care what it will cost? I&#8217;ll pay. Wire
your Lava chief that the money is here. Send the
doctor on ahead of the regular train&ndash;&ndash;can&#8217;t wait
for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had the Lorrigan habit of carrying a good
deal of money on his person, and he counted out
banknotes until the operator lifted his hand and
said it was enough. He slammed out, then,
mounted and rode to a livery stable and gave orders
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;And I&#8217;ll <i>buy</i> the damn team, so kill &#8217;em if
you have to. Only get the doctor out there.&#8221; He
was in the saddle and gone again before the stableman
had recovered from his sag-jawed astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess there&#8217;s something in that talk of him and
the Douglas girl,&#8221; the stableman gossiped to a
friend while he harnessed his swiftest team.</p>
<p>In ten minutes under the three hours Lance
stopped at the house, went in and saw that Mary
Hope was still being game, and was very glad to
be in his arms, and that Mother Douglas was alive
and staring up at the ceiling, her face set in a
deadly kind of calm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She moves her eyes to me, sometimes&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s
been awake for almost an hour. But she hasn&#8217;t
moved&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Her voice broke.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right&ndash;&ndash;the doctor is on his way. And
I&#8217;m here, sweetheart&ndash;&ndash;you won&#8217;t be alone again.
Where&#8217;s that man of yours? I&#8217;ll send him over
with a note to Belle. She&#8217;ll come&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s a wonder
with sick folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m afraid mother wouldn&#8217;t let her&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s
that <i>set!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance looked at the corpse-like figure with the
wide-open eyes and a flicker of the lids now and
then to show that she was alive, and swallowed
a lump in his throat. Mother Douglas would probably
not know who was with her, he thought.</p>
<p>Coaley, the proud-spirited, shambled slowly to
the stable, his head drooping, his eyes dulled with
exhaustion. He had done his part. Lance rubbed
him down, blanketed him, working swiftly, his
thoughts with Mary Hope and her love and her
fresh grief. He found Hugh, scribbled a note to
Belle and got him started on Jamie.</p>
<p>Mother Douglas moved her eyes, stared at him
sharply when he went to her. But she did not
speak, did not move a muscle of her face. The
heart of Lance went heavy, but he could smile still
at Mary Hope and tell her that it was all right,
and that the doctor ought to be there in an hour
or so, and that Belle would come, and that he
loved her, loved her, loved her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h2>
<h3>BELLE LORRIGAN WINS</h3>
</div>
<p>In the second-best suit of Aleck Douglas, with his
wrists showing strong and shapely below the
coat sleeves, and wrinkles across his back, Lance
turned his own steaming apparel before the
kitchen fire and waited to hear what the doctor
had to say.</p>
<p>In his mind was a great wonder at the inscrutable
operations of Fate, that had twice brought tragedy
into the Douglas house while he himself was permitted
to bring all his love, which without the
tragedies might have been rejected; which had
sent him hurrying to Mary Hope on this day of
all the days when he had longed to come. He
could not believe that blind Chance had irresponsibly
twisted the threads of Mary Hope&#8217;s life so that
these things had come upon her. He was abashed,
humbled, filled with awe of the tremendous forces
that rule our destinies. For perhaps the first
time in his life he stood face to face with something
beyond his understanding, something against
which his arrogant young strength was powerless.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>The doctor presently came to him, beckoned him
to the doorway and preceded him into the rain-washed
yard, where the late afternoon sun shone
with dazzling brightness after the storm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;ll live through this,&#8221; the doctor began
abruptly. &#8220;It was not the lightning, altogether,
though she undoubtedly did receive a severe
shock. There has been a predisposition to
paralysis, which is the true nature of this attack.
Her right side is completely paralyzed, and so far
as I can determine after a more-or-less superficial
examination, her vocal chords are also affected,
making speech impossible. Her left arm is not
affected, and her mind seems fairly normal. Too
much work, too much worry, too much monotony&ndash;&ndash;and
she has reached the time of life when these
things are most apt to occur. Her husband&#8217;s
death was undoubtedly a contributary cause.
With proper medical attention she may recover
from this attack&ndash;&ndash;partially, at least. She should
be removed to a good hospital, or a trained nurse
placed in charge of the case here. That will be
expensive. Do you know whether the family can
afford&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The family can afford anything she needs,
anything that will give her a chance,&#8221; Lance told
him brusquely.</p>
<p>&#8220;She will probably be an invalid as long as she
lives,&#8221; the doctor went on. &#8220;She will be a great
care. Are there any relatives, other than the girl?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
It&#8217;s a tremendous burden to fall on her shoulders,
Mr. Lorrigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The burden,&#8221; said Lance, &#8220;will not fall on her
shoulders. I don&#8217;t mind telling you that Miss
Douglas and I will be married very soon. As soon
as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor brightened visibly. &#8220;Congratulations,
Mr. Lorrigan! I should strongly advise
you, then, to have the old lady removed to a nice,
quiet hospital. You will not want the care of her&ndash;&ndash;young
people should not be handicapped in that
way. I can make the necessary arrangements.
She should not be subjected to the discomforts of
the journey just at present&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s a long way by
team, and a long way by train. I should like to
have her as quiet as possible for a few days, at
least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll look after that,&#8221; said Lance, and hurried
in to tell Mary Hope that her mother was not
going to die, and that Belle was coming&ndash;&ndash;he could
hear the rattle of the buckboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what mother will say,&#8221; Mary
Hope began, and stopped and hid her eyes behind
her hands. Her mother, poor soul, could not say
anything. It seemed terrible to Mary Hope that
her mother must lie there and endure the presence
of the painted Jezebel in her home, and be unable
to utter one word of denunciation, one bitter reproach.
It was like a judgment; and she could
not bear the thought that her mother must suffer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
it. A judgment, or treachery on her part,&ndash;&ndash;the
terrible treason of a child betraying her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, girl; you don&#8217;t <i>know</i> our Belle.
We&#8217;ll just leave it to her. She&#8217;ll find a way. And
I&#8217;ll go out now and tell her all about it, and leave
her to manage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; Mary Hope decided unexpectedly.
&#8220;I have things to say&ndash;&ndash;you shall not go, Lance
Lorrigan. You will please let me see her alone&ndash;&ndash;first.
I&#8217;m that afraid of Belle Lorrigan I could
creep under the table and hide! And so I shall
go alone to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance surrendered, and rolled a cigarette and
smoked it in the kitchen, and wondered if a cigarette
had ever been smoked in that house before,
and whether the ghost of Aleck Douglas was somewhere
near, struggling vainly against the inevitable.
It certainly was unbelievable that a Lorrigan
should be there, master&ndash;&ndash;in effect, at least&ndash;&ndash;of
the Douglas household, wearing the shoddy garments
of Aleck Douglas, and finding them at least
three sizes too small.</p>
<p>They were an unconscionably long time out
there,&ndash;&ndash;those two women who meant so much to
him. He glanced in at Mother Douglas, in bed
now and looking terribly shrunken and old. The
doctor was with her, sitting close to the bed and
leaning forward a little, watching her eyes while
he talked soothingly. Lance was not wanted
there, either. He returned to the kitchen and put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
more wood in the stove, and felt tentatively his
drying clothes.</p>
<p>Belle came in, holding Mary Hope by the hand.
The eyes of both were moist, shining, blue as the
sky outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance, honey, I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; she whispered, kissing
him on the cheek. &#8220;Hope told me. And don&#8217;t
you two kids worry about me. I&#8217;ll win my way
somehow. I always have&ndash;&ndash;and I guess maybe
you&#8217;ve got it in you, too, Lance. It sure took
something more than Lorrigan nerve to win Mary
Hope&ndash;&ndash;though I&#8217;ll admit Lorrigan nerve won me.
No, I won&#8217;t go in there now. Don&#8217;t tell her I&#8217;m
here, we&#8217;ll wait awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was dusk, and the lamp had not yet been
lighted. Through the unshaded window Mother
Douglas could look out at the first pale stars. The
doctor had gone. The house was very quiet, the
snapping of the kitchen fire, the steady <i>tick</i>-tock,
<i>tick</i>-tock of the old-fashioned clock blending with,
rather than breaking, the silence.</p>
<p>Mother Douglas closed her eyes. Her groping
left hand ceased its aimless plucking at a yarn
knot in the patchwork comforter. Her breath
came evenly&ndash;&ndash;Mary Hope wondered if she slept.
A hand fell on Mary Hope&#8217;s shoulder, though
she had not heard a footfall. She seemed prepared,
seemed to know what she must do. She
slipped out of the chair, and Belle slipped into it.
Mother Douglas opened her eyes, turned them that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
way; infinite weariness marked the glance. Her
left hand resumed again its vague groping, the
work-worn fingers plucking at the coverlet.</p>
<p>Sitting there in the dusk, her fingers faintly outlined
in the old wooden armchair in which Aleck
Douglas had been wont to sit and brood somberly
over his work and his wrongs, Belle began softly
to sing:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;<i>Ye banks and braes o&#8217; bonnie Doon,</i><br />
<i>How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair?</i>&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The withered hand lay still, the fingers clutching
tightly a fold of cotton cloth. Mother Douglas
looked and closed her eyes. Leaning close,
when the song was finished, Belle saw that the
grim lips were trembling, that tears were slipping
down the too calm face. With her handkerchief
she wiped away the tears, and sang again. The
&#8220;Girl with a Thousand Songs&#8221; had many Scottish
melodies in her repertoire, and the years had
not made her forget.</p>
<p>At the last, the groping left hand reached painfully
across, found Belle&#8217;s hand waiting, and
closed on it tightly. Whenever Belle stopped
singing the hand would clutch hers. When she
began again the fingers would relax a little. It
was not much, but it was enough.</p>
<p>In the kitchen Mary Hope moved quietly about,
cooking supper, straining and putting away the
milk Hugh brought in. In the kitchen Lance sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
and watched her, and made love to her with his big
eyes, with his voice that made of the most commonplace
remark a caress.</p>
<p>But that night, when Mary Hope was asleep and
Belle was dozing beside the stricken woman, Lance
saddled Jamie and led Coaley home. And while
he rode, black Trouble rode with him and Love
could not smile and beat back the spectre with his
fists, but hid his face and whimpered, and was
afraid.</p>
<p>For Lance was face to face again with that sinister,
unnamed Something that hung over the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth ranch. He might forget it for a few
hours, engrossed with his love and in easing this
new trouble that had come to Mary Hope; he might
forget, but that did not make his own trouble any
the less menacing, any the less real.</p>
<p>He could not tell her so, now while she had this
fresh worry over her mother, but Lance knew&ndash;&ndash;and
while he rode slowly he faced the knowledge&ndash;&ndash;that
he could not marry Mary Hope while the
cloud hung over the Devil&#8217;s Tooth. And that
there was a cloud, a black, ominous cloud from
which the lightning might be expected to strike and
blast the Lorrigans, he could not deny. It was
there. He knew it, knew just how loud were its
mutterings, knew that it was gathering swiftly,
pushing up over the horizon faster than did the
storm of the morning.</p>
<p>He would not put Coaley down the Slide trail,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
but took him around by the wagon road. They
plodded along at a walk, Coaley&#8217;s stiffened muscles
giving him the gait of an old horse. There had
been no urgent need to take Coaley home at once,
but it was an excuse, and Lance used it. He could
not think,&ndash;&ndash;he could not face his own trouble
when he was near Mary Hope. She drove everything
else from his mind, and Lance knew that
some things must not be driven from his mind.
He had set himself to do certain things. Now,
with Mary Hope loving him, there was all the more
reason why he should do them.</p>
<p>The ranch seemed deserted, though of course it
was late and he knew that every one would be in
bed. He found a lantern, put Coaley into the
box stall again, and spent a long time rubbing him
down and carrying him fresh hay and water. He
went up then and roused Sam Pretty Cow, who was
sleeping in the small cabin he had elected to make
his own private habitation on the ranch. Sam
Pretty Cow told him that no one had come home
as yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two, three days, I dunno. Mebby Tom comes
then,&#8221; he hazarded, blinking at Lance. &#8220;This
too quick. Nobody comes back same day, you bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance stood looking down at him, scowling
thoughtfully. &#8220;Sam, you&#8217;ve been a long time with
the outfit. You&#8217;ve been a good man. You aren&#8217;t
crippled up&ndash;&ndash;and you&#8217;re the best rider of the
bunch of us. Why don&#8217;t <i>you</i> go out any more?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></div>
<p>Sam lighted a cigarette, blew out the blazing
match and laid the burnt stub carefully on a box.
He smoked stolidly, gazing at the dingy wall before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bust them bronks in the corral,&#8221; he said at
last, grinning briefly. &#8220;You stay long, you see
me ride. Uh-huh&ndash;&ndash;yo&#8217; bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes. That&#8217;s all right. But why don&#8217;t
you go with the outfit?&#8221; Lance leaned against the
wall, arms folded, studying him. It was almost
hopeless, trying to get anything out of Sam Pretty
Cow; still, Lance tried it.</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow looked up at him, looked down
at his bare feet that he had swung out of bed when
Lance wakened him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. That&#8217;s why. That all right, I&#8217;m go.
That ain&#8217;t all right, I&#8217;m don&#8217; go. You bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance tap-tapped his right arm with the fingers
of his left hand, chewed his lip and looked at Sam
Pretty Cow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, dad lets you stick around the outfit,&#8221; he
drawled meaningly.</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow shot a quick glance toward him,
looked at the door, relaxed again and studied his
toes which he wriggled on the dirty floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m good man, you bet. I&#8217;m mind my business.&#8221;
He drew a long breath, glanced again
from the door to Lance&#8217;s face. &#8220;Tom&#8217;s damn
smart man&ndash;&ndash;me, I&#8217;m mebby smarter. I dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance looked down at him, smiling strangely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
&#8220;Sam, I&#8217;m minding my business, too. I&#8217;m doing
it by&ndash;&ndash;not minding my own business. Tom Lorrigan&#8217;s
a smart man&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m Tom Lorrigan&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam turned his foot over, looked critically at
the calloused sole of it, turned it back again
and blew a mouthful of smoke. &#8220;Yeah&ndash;&ndash;uh-huh.
You damn smart&ndash;&ndash;you don&#8217;t like them
damn jail. I&#8217;m don&#8217;t. We both smart, you
bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance lifted an eyebrow. &#8220;What&#8217;s the Piegan
word for <i>accomplice</i>, Sam?&#8221; he asked softly.</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow considered. &#8220;Me, I&#8217;m don&#8217;
know them damn word,&#8221; he decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a word that sends smart men to jail, Sam.
It means the man that stays at home and&ndash;&ndash;<i>knows</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow tucked his feet under the thin
blanket, laid his half-smoked cigarette on the box,
with the burning end out over the edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. Yeah. You bet.&#8221; He looked up at
Lance, for the first time meeting his eyes squarely.
&#8220;I&#8217;m know them damn word you call. Nh-hn.
Long time I&#8217;m got that what it mean on my heart.
You&#8217;re damn right.&#8221; He waited a minute, saw
the Lorrigan look on Lance&#8217;s face, on his lips that
smiled enigmatically. &#8220;Them Californy got
bronks to bust?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know, Sam. But that&#8217;s all
right. You stay.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow looked doubtful as an Indian
may ever be expected to look.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay, Sam. There&#8217;ll be bronks to bust on
the Devil&#8217;s Tooth for a long while yet.&#8221; He
moved to the door, pulled it open and stood looking
out. Only a few miles away Mary Hope lay
asleep, loving him in her dreams, please God.
Here, the Shadow hung black over the Devil&#8217;s
Tooth. He turned to Sam Pretty Cow whose hand
was stretched toward the smoky lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget that word, Sam. It doesn&#8217;t mean
anything at all&ndash;&ndash;to a Piegan. And Sam, if I&#8217;m
not around to-morrow morning, you ride over to
the Douglas ranch, and take back the horse I borrowed.
Belle may want to send you to town.
She&#8217;s there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Pretty Cow&#8217;s eyes widened appreciably.
&#8220;Uh-huh&ndash;&ndash;all right. I&#8217;m go,&#8221; he promised, and
blew out the light.</p>
<p>Lance went slowly up to the house and lay face
downward on his bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h2>
<h3>THE DOPE</h3>
</div>
<p>Traveling lightly, Lance had covered a hundred
and fifty miles in four days, through
country where trails were few and rough. He had
made wide detours, had slept on the ground in his
slicker, had eaten bacon and bannocks cooked in
the small frying pan which he carried in the sack
with his meager rations. He had missed altogether
the Devil&#8217;s Tooth outfit, and was swinging
back now by way of the Lava Beds, where Tom had
said that they were going. It was because Tom
had named that as his destination that Lance had
ridden elsewhere to find him; good reasoning, but
so far unproductive of results.</p>
<p>Four days, and he had not heard from Mary
Hope, had learned nothing conclusive, either for
or against the Devil&#8217;s Tooth. Some clues he had
gleaned, some evidence that strengthened his suspicions,
but nothing to make him feel that the trip
had been worth the hardship.</p>
<p>Without knowing just why, he had ridden out
expecting to learn the best or the worst and have
done with nagging suspicion. It had seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
him that Fate meant to be kind, that his destiny
and Mary Hope&#8217;s pointed the way to happiness.
Now he was beginning to doubt. How was happiness
possible, if the outlaw blood of the Lorrigans
ran at high pressure through the veins of
his family? He did not know to a certainty that
it did, but until he knew that it did not he could
never marry Mary Hope. He had to know. It
had been pure madness, going to her as he had
gone. While his horse plodded up the hill to
where the lava outcroppings began, Lance meditated
gloomily on the madness that had driven
him to her. He had felt so sure of himself and his
future, so much the master of his destiny and hers!
Yet, even while he wooed her tempestuously he had
known that it was madness, that Trouble was
reaching even then to pluck him by the sleeve.
Mary Hope and her stern, Scotch integrity linked
to the blackened Lorrigan name that might soon
stand on the roster of the State&#8217;s prison? It was
impossible, inconceivable. He had been a hound
to say to her what he had said.</p>
<p>True, when her mother was stricken he had been
there to help her, to comfort her. But it would be
small comfort to Mary Hope when the storm broke
over the Devil&#8217;s Tooth.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I said Fate was with us&ndash;&ndash;I said nothing
could hurt her! And it will hurt her all her life.&#8221;</p>
<p>His sweaty horse paused to breathe, heaving a
great sigh, looking discouragedly at the climb yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
before him. Lance came to himself and swung
off, giving the horse an apologetic slap on the
shoulder. &#8220;You ought to kick me cold, Sorry, for
making you pack my hulking carcase up this hill.
Why didn&#8217;t you stop at the bottom?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry looked at him, waited for Lance to take
the lead, and climbed after him more briskly.
He was a big-boned, well-muscled animal, but two
hundred pounds had been a heavy load to carry up
hill, and he was glad to be rid of it.</p>
<p>At the top Lance did not remount. The thickly
strewn flat rocks made treacherous footing, and
more than one man had taken a nasty fall because
he had chosen to ride that mile of lava when he
should have walked. It was somewhere along this
stretch of rock outcropping that Shorty had
broken his knee so that he would never ride again
to the round-up.</p>
<p>Lance was walking along with his head down,
brooding over his trouble, when he fancied he
heard a faint halloo. Sorry stopped and craned
his head. But Lance could see nothing save the
barren stretch of lava and the monotonous wilderness
beyond, with mountains in the far background
and the Black Rim stretching grim on the left of
him. He started on, thinking that perhaps some
animal or bird was responsible for the sound.
But he had gone but a short distance when it came
again, more distinctly because he was half listening
for it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>He waited, made a guess at the location of the
person who shouted, and turned that way, changing
the reins from his right hand to his left and
pulling his holstered six-shooter within easy reach
of his hand. This was not the country, his was
not the errand, for carelessness, and Lance was
taking no risk.</p>
<p>As he walked his eyes roved continually over
the brown expanse of rocks and stunted juniper
that formed the Lava Beds. Behind him came
Sorry, his worn shoes slipping now and then on a
smooth rock, his head bobbing patiently, close to
Lance&#8217;s shoulder. As so often happens, it was the
horse that first discovered the object of their
search. He pulled away from the direct line, looking
and looking at what Lance, keen-eyed though
he was, mistook for a black rock with a juniper
bush growing beside it.</p>
<p>Lance turned that way, focussed his glasses
upon the object and saw what had happened. A
horse had fallen with its rider, the two lying together,
the man pinned under the horse. A black
horse which he recognized, and a big, red-faced
cowpuncher with gray eyes that did not twinkle.
While Lance looked, the man lifted his head,
seemed to be staring straight into Lance&#8217;s face,
opened his mouth and contorted his pain-racked
face in a shout. It was strange to have the sound
reach Lance&#8217;s ears thinned and weakened by distance,
while the glasses brought the injured man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
so close that he could see the wild look of entreaty
in his eyes. Lance put up the glasses and began
running, with Sorry stumbling and slipping behind
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I been here since morning,&#8221; the big cowpuncher
chattered feverishly when Lance came up
to him. &#8220;I&#8217;m fixed, all right! I was dozing and
I didn&#8217;t jump and he caught me when he fell. I
guess his leg is broke, but so is mine, fur&#8217;s that
goes. I come down hard on a rock and I guess I
broke some ribs or something. Hurt like hell for
a few hours&ndash;&ndash;it ain&#8217;t so bad now. Look out when
you go to make him git up&ndash;&ndash;if he rolls on me it&#8217;s
all off. I guess it&#8217;s all off, anyway, but I don&#8217;t
want to be squashed to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance bit his lip. It was hard to hear the man
talking, talking, in that rapid, headlong fashion,
while his leg lay under the full weight of the black
horse and the sun blazed on his uncovered head.
It was hard to see his shirt all blood-soaked on
the left side where he had fallen across an uptilted,
thin-edged rock.</p>
<p>The horse, too, was in sorry state. A weed-grown
crevice had cheated him with its semblance
to sound footing, and he lay with front leg broken,
groaning a little now and then while the man talked
and talked. And while he examined the two it
seemed to Lance that Fate was pointing, and saying
that here, too, was one of the inscrutable instruments
by which he worked out the destinies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
of men. A slippery rock, a man riding that way
half asleep&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to shoot this horse, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221;
Lance said pityingly. &#8220;His leg is broken&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
the most merciful thing I can do. And if I try to
lift him off you while he&#8217;s alive he may struggle&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing! Go on and shoot him! I woulda
done it myself if you hadn&#8217;t come along purty soon.
I knowed it would be all off with us both if we had
to lay out all night, so I was going to finish us
both off, when I seen you. Thought I&#8217;d take a
gambling chance till dark&ndash;&ndash;but the sun has been
baking me to a crisp&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll get you to a ranch. We&#8217;ll
fix you up, so don&#8217;t think about the finish.&#8221; A
little of the color had left Lance&#8217;s face. Shooting
a horse was to him next thing to shooting a
human. He had to do it, though. There was no
other way.</p>
<p>He took the horse by the cheek-piece of the
bridle, spoke to him gently, turned the head a little
away from him so that the horse could not look
him in the eyes. &#8220;Poor old fellow, it&#8217;s all I can
do for you,&#8221; he muttered when he pulled his gun
from the holster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you better do the same for me,&#8221; said
the man, still speaking in the rapid tone which told
of fever. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t able to heave him off me,
are you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m able to. Lie still, now, and grit your
teeth, old man. It may hurt, when I lift him off
your leg. I&#8217;ll raise him up and put a rock under,
and pull you out. Can you stand that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Hell, yes. Ain&#8217;t I been standing pain
since before daylight? Me, I can stand anything
if I have to!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet he fainted when Lance took him by the
shoulders and pulled him free, and Lance used
half the water in the canteen on the saddle in
bringing him back to consciousness. When the
fellow opened his eyes, Lance remembered that he
had half a pint of whisky in his coat pocket, and
offered it to the injured one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Golly, that&#8217;s a life-saver!&#8221; he ejaculated when
he had taken two swallows. He reached down and
felt his crushed leg, grimacing at the pain of returning
circulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s busted all right. Busted <i>right</i>, if I&#8217;m
any judge. And my side&ndash;&ndash;things are all busted
up in there. I know it. Say, oldtimer, how do
you figure you&#8217;re going to get me outa here? Do
you know it&#8217;s all of ten miles to the nearest ranch?
I&#8217;ve got a map of the whole country in my coat
pocket. I&#8217;ll show yuh if you don&#8217;t know. You&#8217;re
a stranger, I guess. I don&#8217;t recollect seeing yore
horse before. I always know horses. What&#8217;s his
brand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance did not say. He himself was wondering
how he was going to get the man out of there. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
the fellow thought he was a stranger, all the better.
Still, it did not matter much. Already the
whisky was whipping the man&#8217;s brain to quicker
action, loosening his tongue that had already been
set wagging by fever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you can stand it to ride?&#8221; he asked solicitously.
&#8220;I can heave you into the saddle, if you
can stand being moved. I&#8217;d ride to the next ranch
and bring a wagon&ndash;&ndash;but the country&#8217;s too rough.
A rig couldn&#8217;t get within five miles of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. Not even Belle Lorrigan&#8217;s buckboard
could make it across that canyon on beyond.
Say, speaking of the Lorrigans&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he hesitated,
then plunged recklessly on. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to pass
you some dope I&#8217;ve got on that outfit. The
chances are I&#8217;m done for. The way my insides
feel&ndash;&ndash;and you do something for me, will you? If
I cash in, you turn in this dope. We may as well
&#8217;tend to this business right now, before I tackle
the job of riding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance stood looking down at him while he fumbled
in his pocket, pulled out a small leather notebook
and some papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a stock detective, see. My name&#8217;s Burt
Brownlee. I was just about ready to turn in the
dope and have the whole outfit pulled. Well, it&#8217;s
all here. They been rustling right and left, see.
But they&#8217;re cute&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re <i>damn</i> cute. We been
trying to work up the case on the outside, and it
seemed like somebody in the Black Rim was sending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
stock out, and so I&#8217;ve been working on this end.
Now here&#8217;s the data. I followed &#8217;em, and I&#8217;ve got
the dope. I know now how they work it, and my
evidence and this dope here, that can be verified
later on when the time comes, will put the whole
bunch over the road, see. They&#8217;re outlaws&ndash;&ndash;always
have been&ndash;&ndash;but they won&#8217;t be by the time
they get outa the pen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You better keep that,&#8221; Lance cut in gruffly.
&#8220;Man, that&#8217;s nothing you want to be gabbling to a
stranger. Shut up, and let me put you on my
horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I want to tell yuh,&#8221; Burt insisted with all
the obstinacy of a man half crazy with pain and
whisky. &#8220;I want to tell yuh, and I&#8217;m going to
tell yuh! Get down here and listen. Here&#8217;s a
map, and here&#8217;s the brands they worked, and
here&#8217;s how they worked &#8217;em. And here&#8217;s the
dates.&#8221;</p>
<p>On one knee Lance kneeled and listened, his jaws
set hard together. Fast as the man talked the
thoughts of Lance flew ahead, snatched at the
significance of every detail, every bit of evidence.
Some things puzzled Burt Brownlee, but Lance
knew the answer to the puzzle while Burt talked
and talked. Finally he laid his hand over the
finely traced maps that showed secret trails, unguessed,
hidden little draws where stolen stock
had been concealed, all the fine threads that would
weave the net close around the Lorrigans.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Here, put that stuff up. This is not getting
you to a doctor, and this can wait. Put it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you take it. And if I don&#8217;t pull through,
you turn it in. You keep it. I don&#8217;t want to be
found dead with that dope on <i>me</i>&ndash;&ndash;you can&#8217;t tell
who might get hold of it.&#8221; He thrust the papers
and the book eagerly into Lance&#8217;s unwilling hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o, you can&#8217;t tell who might get hold of it,&#8221;
Lance admitted, biting his lip. &#8220;Well, let me take
your riding outfit off this horse and then we&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he pulled saddle and bridle off the dead
horse, Burt Brownlee talked and talked and talked.
He wanted more whisky, which Lance promised
him he should have when he was ready to get on
the horse. He told further evidence against the
Devil&#8217;s Tooth, told how he had followed Tom for
two days only to see him later at the ranch where
he had returned while Burt had for a time lost the
trail. On that trip, he said, he would have gotten
the full details of one &#8220;job&#8221; had he not turned off
to follow Tom Lorrigan.</p>
<p>While he worked Lance listened stoically.
When he was ready to start he led Sorry close,
lifted the fellow as tenderly as he could, saw him
faint again with the pain, and somehow got him
on the horse while he was still unconscious. Burt
Brownlee was a big man, but he was not of great
weight. Lance bound him to the saddle with his
own riata, revived him with a little more whisky,
and started for Conley&#8217;s, who lived nearest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>It was ten miles to Conleys, as riders guessed
the distance. Lance walked and led Sorry, and
tried to hold Burt Brownlee in the saddle, and
listened to his rambling talk, and gave him more
whisky when he seemed ready to die. During
certain intervals when Burt seemed lucid enough
to realize his desperate condition, Lance heartened
him with assurance that they were almost there.</p>
<p>On the way into the canyon Burt Brownlee suffered
greatly on the steep trail, down which the
horse must go with forward joltings that racked
terribly the man&#8217;s crushed side. The whisky was
gone; he had finished the scanty supply at the
canyon&#8217;s crest, because he begged for it so hard
that Lance could not steel himself to refuse. At
the bottom Lance stopped Sorry, and put an arm
around Burt. Lance&#8217;s face was set masklike in
its forced calm, but his voice was very tender, with
the deep, vibrant note Mary Hope loved so ardently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lean against me, old man, and rest a minute.
It&#8217;s pretty tough going, but you&#8217;re game. You&#8217;re
dead game. You&#8217;ll make it. Wait. I&#8217;ll stand on
this rock&ndash;&ndash;now lean hard, and rest. Ho, there&#8217;s no
whisky&ndash;&ndash;water will have to do you, now. I&#8217;ve
a little in my canteen, and when you&#8217;ve rested&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going,&#8221; said Burt, lurching against
Lance&#8217;s steady strength. &#8220;You&#8217;re a white man.
That Lorrigan dope&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t forget what I told
you&ndash;&ndash;turn it in&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></div>
<p>Lance&#8217;s mouth twisted with sudden bitterness.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;forget,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll turn it&ndash;&ndash;in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;a goner. Just&ndash;&ndash;stand and let me&ndash;&ndash;lean&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance stood, and let him lean, and with his handkerchief
he very gently dried Burt&#8217;s cold, perspiring
face. It seemed an endless time that he stood
there. Now and then Burt clutched him with fingers
that gripped his shoulders painfully, but
Lance never moved. Once, when Sorry turned his
head and looked back inquiringly, wondering why
they did not go on, Lance spoke to the horse and
his voice was calm and soothing. But when it was
all over, Lance&#8217;s underlip was bleeding at the
corner where he had bitten into it.</p>
<p>He walked into Conley&#8217;s yard an hour after that,
his face drearily impassive, a dead man lashed to
the saddle. He asked for paper and a pen, and in
a firm, even handwriting he described tersely the
manner of Burt Brownlee&#8217;s death, told where the
dead horse and the saddle would be found, and as
an afterthought, lest there be trouble in locating
the spot, he drew a sketch of that particular part
of the Lava Beds. He signed the statement, and
had the excited Conleys, shaking man and half
hysterical wife, sign also as witnesses. His matter-of-fact
treatment of the affair impressed them
to the point of receiving his instructions as though
they were commands which must on no account be
disobeyed in any particular.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back and tell the coroner. He&#8217;ll want
to see the horse and saddle, perhaps. Mr. Conley,
you can find them without any trouble. If he
wants an inquest, tell him I&#8217;ll be on hand. Thank
you, Mrs. Conley,&ndash;&ndash;no, I&#8217;ll not wait for anything
to eat. I&#8217;m not hungry. I must get home.
Good-by&ndash;&ndash;sorry I can&#8217;t do any more for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He mounted Sorry, pricked him into a gallop,
and presently disappeared around a bend of the
trail that led in the direction of the Devil&#8217;s Tooth
ranch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h2>
<h3>HOW ONE TRAIL ENDED</h3>
</div>
<p>Darkness falls late on the Black Rim country
in midsummer. It was just deepening
from dusk when Lance rode up to the corral gate,
pulled the saddle and bridle off Sorry with swift
jerks that bespoke a haste born of high nervous
tension, and strode up to the house. From the
bunk house, when he passed, came the murmur of
low-keyed voices. The outfit, then, was at home
once more. From the shaded window of Belle&#8217;s
bedroom a thin silver of light shone, where the
blind was curled back at the edge, but the rest of
the house was dark. He went in, moving softly,
but Belle must have heard his step on the porch,
for she came out with her bedroom lamp in her
hand, the other raised to impress quiet upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance, honey! Where on earth have you
been?&#8221; She set the lamp down on the table and
came close, putting her arms around him, her eyes
searching the impenetrable calm of his face, the
veiled purpose behind his eyes. It was the Lorrigan
fighting look; she had seen it once or twice in
Tom&#8217;s face and it had frightened her. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
frightened now, but her own intrepid soul pushed
back her fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sh-sh</i>, honey,&#8221; she whispered, though Lance
had neither moved nor spoken since she touched
him. &#8220;<i>Sh-sh</i>&ndash;&ndash;Mary Hope and her mother are
here, and they&#8217;re both asleep. I&ndash;&ndash;honey, we were
so worried, when you didn&#8217;t come back. That note
you sent didn&#8217;t say a <i>thing</i>, and I was afraid&ndash;&ndash;And
I was between the devil and the deep sea,
honey. I couldn&#8217;t stay away from here, when I
didn&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;and I couldn&#8217;t leave Hope there,
and the women that came flocking when they heard
the news were just <i>cows</i> for brains. And the old
lady won&#8217;t have a nurse and she <i>wouldn&#8217;t</i> let me
out of her sight&ndash;&ndash;she keeps me singing about all
the time she&#8217;s awake, or reciting poetry&ndash;&ndash;Bobbie
Burns, mostly, and Scott. Would you ever <i>think</i>
she&#8217;d stand for Bobbie Burns? But I can do it
as Scotch as she can, and she likes it.</p>
<p>&#8220;So she wouldn&#8217;t let me leave, and I couldn&#8217;t
stay&ndash;&ndash;and I had Hugh make up a bed in the
spring wagon, and brought her over here. If you
and Hope are going to be married right away, the
old lady will need to be here, anyway. The doctor
tried to talk hospital&ndash;&ndash;he just <i>tried</i>. The old
lady can write now with her left hand so we can
make it out, and when he said hospital to her she&ndash;&ndash;she
almost swore.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s all right, Lance, honey&ndash;&ndash;my God,
Lance, <i>what is it</i>? Have you heard from Duke?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
She broke down suddenly, and clutched him in a
way that reminded him poignantly of that dying
man in the canyon. Her whisper became sibilant,
terrified. &#8220;<i>What is it?</i> What has happened?
Lance, <i>tell</i> me! Tom is here, and Al; they were
here when we came, to-day&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance took a deep breath. Very gently he
leaned and kissed her on the forehead, reached
back and pulled her hands away from his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing, Belle. I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;tired. And you&ndash;&ndash;you
surprised me. Will it waken them if I&ndash;&ndash;clean
up a little before I go to bed? I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;be careful.&#8221;
He forced his eyes, his lips, to smile at
her. &#8220;Good girl, Belle. I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re a trump.
Now go back to bed. Lance is on the job&ndash;&ndash;Lance
won&#8217;t leave again like that&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;settle down.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down on the nearest chair and pulled off
his boots. He made an imperative gesture toward
her bedroom, and Belle, giving him a strange,
searching look, went in and closed the door after
her. He gave a sigh of relief when she was gone,
never dreaming how little he had imposed upon
her.</p>
<p>In his stocking feet he went to the kitchen, found
hot water in the teakettle, carried it to his room and
shaved, cleansing his body as well as he could from
the dust of the trip without making any sound that
might disturb the sleeping invalid and Mary Hope.
He dressed himself carefully as though he were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
going to meet guests. The set look was still in
his face when he stood before the dresser mirror,
knotting the blue tie that harmonized best with the
shirt he wore. He pulled the tan leather belt
straight, so that the plain silver buckle was in the
middle, took something off the bed and pushed
it carefully inside the waistband of his trousers,
on the left side, taking great care that its position
was right to the fraction of an inch. He took his
tan Oxford shoes in his hand, pulled open his door
as quietly as any burglar could have done, stepped
down upon the ground and put on the shoes, lacing
them carefully, tucking in the bow ends fastidiously.</p>
<p>Then, moving very softly, he went down the path
to the bunk-house, opened the door and walked in,
never dreaming that Belle was no more than a
dozen steps behind him, or that, when he closed
the door, she was standing just outside, listening.</p>
<p>The blood of his actress mother carried him
insouciantly over the pregnant silence that received
him. He leaned negligently against the
wall beside the closed door, his arms folded, his
eyebrows tilted upward at the inner ends, his lips
smiling quizzically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve another funny story to tell you fellows,&#8221;
he drawled, just before the silence became awkward.
&#8220;Glad you&#8217;re all here&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s too good to
keep, too good to waste on part of the outfit. I
want you all to get the kick. You&#8217;ll enjoy it&ndash;&ndash;being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
cattlemen. It&#8217;s a joke that was pulled on an
outfit down in Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like a trained monologist, he had them listening,
deceived by his smiling ease, waiting to hear
the joke on the Arizona outfit. Tom and Al, at
the table with some papers before them, papers
that held figures and scribbled names, he quite
overlooked. But they, too, listened to the story,
were imposed upon by that quizzical smile, by his
mimicry, by the bold, swift strokes with which he
painted word pictures which their imaginations
seized upon as fast as they were made.</p>
<p>It was Tom who first felt a suspicion of Lance&#8217;s
purpose, and shifted his position a little, so that
his right hand would be free. As he did so, without
looking toward him Lance&#8217;s left fingers began
tapping, tapping the muscles of his right arm;
his right hand had sagged a little. Tom&#8217;s eyebrows
pulled together. Quite well he knew that
pose. He waited, listened with closer attention to
the story.</p>
<p>Lance paused, as your skillful <i>raconteur</i> usually
does pause before the climax. His glance
went impersonally over the faces of his audience.
Most of them were leaning forward, a few were
breathing hard. They were listening, straining
unconsciously to get the meaning he withheld from
them. Lance&#8217;s right hand sagged another half
inch, his lips pulled sidewise in the enigmatical
smile of the Lorrigans.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I lied, of course&ndash;&ndash;about the outfit this joke
is on. It&#8217;s really the Devil&#8217;s Tooth I&#8217;m talking
about. But the kick remains, so listen, folks, just
listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Lorrigan. Two of you are Lorrigans,
and you know what I mean when I say that. The
rest of you had better <i>guess</i> what I mean, if you
don&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;and guess right!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m talking to you with my back against the
wall&ndash;&ndash;in more ways than one. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m
fool enough not to know it. But you&#8217;re listening
with your backs against another wall; I believe it
is of stone, usually, and the windows have bars.
I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re such fools you fail to grasp
my meaning. I&#8217;m talking&ndash;&ndash;and you&#8217;re going to
listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I said&ndash;&ndash;well, I have the dope, you know.
I know where you took that last bunch of stolen
horses, and I know the date when you turned them
over. I have a map or two&ndash;&ndash;I know those secret
trails you made, that lead into that hidden little
basin that the Rim has not discovered yet. I&#8217;ve
dope enough to indict the whole outfit on five separate
counts&ndash;&ndash;and any one of them will put every
man of you in the pen for a term of years&ndash;&ndash;well,
from five to ten up to fifteen or twenty&ndash;&ndash;a mere
detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know why Duke didn&#8217;t come back. There&#8217;s
a yellow streak in Duke, and he lost his nerve and
drifted to parts unknown. Where, I&#8217;m not curious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
to discover. It doesn&#8217;t matter, so long as his
destination <i>remains</i> unknown.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the story. And now, here&#8217;s the point:
Others, detectives working at the other end of the
business, have an inkling of some of this dope.
They haven&#8217;t got what I&#8217;ve got, but they may
possibly get it. They may&ndash;&ndash;possibly. And if
they do&ndash;&ndash;wel-ll&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He smiled at them, his eyebrows
pointing his meaning, his fingers tapping,
tapping on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to quit. Now, without turning the
deal you&#8217;re working on, you&#8217;ve got to quit. Get
that. Get it right into your souls. You men that
have been hired to steal, you&#8217;ve got to drift.
Where, does not concern me at all. Where Duke
went is good&ndash;&ndash;Parts Unknown. Or if it&#8217;s to hell&ndash;&ndash;why,
the going is good. Never better. You&#8217;ll
go quicker, but there won&#8217;t be any coming back, so
I advise&ndash;&ndash;Parts Unknown.</p>
<p>&#8220;You two Lorrigans&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m not thinking of you
now as my brother and my father&ndash;&ndash;the same advice
applies to you. You&#8217;re Lorrigans. You&#8217;d
rather fight it out than pull out, but you won&#8217;t.
You&#8217;d rather kill me than go. That&#8217;s all right;
I understand perfectly. But&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m Lorrigan,
too. You&#8217;ll go, or I&#8217;ll kill you. Tom Lorrigan,
your hand is pret-ty close to your gun! But so is
mine. You&#8217;d kill me, because I stand in the trail
you&#8217;ve been traveling. But you wouldn&#8217;t kill me
a damn bit quicker than I&#8217;d kill <i>you</i>! I do stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
in the trail&ndash;&ndash;and you&#8217;re going to take another,
both you Lorrigans.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had a debt&ndash;&ndash;a bill of damages against
the Black Rim. Wel-ll,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;you&#8217;ve collected.
Now, to-night, you write &#8216;paid&#8217; across that
bill. You tried to be honest, and the Black Rim
wouldn&#8217;t give you credit for it; they tried to frame
something on you, tried to send you &#8216;over the road&#8217;
on a damned, measly charge you weren&#8217;t small
enough to be guilty of. I understand. The trail
ends right here. You quit. You sit there ready
to kill. But I&#8217;m just as ready as you are. You&#8217;ll
quit, or <i>I&#8217;ll kill you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited, watching Tom. Tom, watching
Lance, got up and faced him cold-eyed, unafraid,
weighing not chances, but values rather.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d kill me, would you!&#8221; he asked, his voice
matching the drawl of Lance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;d kill you!&#8221; Lance smiled back.</p>
<p>Eyes on a level, the two stared at each other,
smiling that deadly, Lorrigan smile, the smile of
old Tom Lorrigan the killer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would, all right,&#8221; Tom said. Then his
stiffened muscles relaxed. A twinkle came into
his eyes. &#8220;If you&#8217;re game enough to do that, kid,
by God, I&#8217;m game enough to quit!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance unfolded his arms, reached out with his
open right hand and met Tom&#8217;s hand in a close
grip. &#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff, dad! I knew you had it
in you&ndash;&ndash;I knew it!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></div>
<p>Outside the door, Belle hugged her six-shooter
to her breast and leaned against the wall, her knees
shaking under her. &#8220;Thank God! Oh, thank
God a Lorrigan can be bigger than all the Lorrigan
blood that&#8217;s in him!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Oh, Lance,
honey&ndash;&ndash;oh, thank God!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h2>
<h3>THE MAKING OF NEW TRAILS</h3>
</div>
<p>At the corral, that time-honored conference
ground of all true range men, the three Lorrigans
leaned their backs against the rails and
talked things over in true range style: laconic
phrases that stated their meaning without frills or
mental reservations, and silences that carried their
thoughts forward to the next utterance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Al can take the outfit and drift,&#8221; said Tom,
as though he were discussing some detail of the
round-up. &#8220;He knows where&ndash;&ndash;and they can scatter,
I&#8217;ll give &#8217;em a horse apiece as a&ndash;&ndash;a kinda
bonus. I&#8217;ll have to stay, looks like. Fall round-up&#8217;s
coming on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wel-ll,&#8221; said Lance, throwing an arm over a
rail and drumming with his fingers, &#8220;I was raised
on round-ups. I don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;ve forgotten all
about it. You might turn the management over
to me for a year or so, and take a trip. Belle
needs it, dad. I think I could keep things riding
along, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds kinda like you had that idea for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
joker up your sleeve,&#8221; Al observed meaningly.
&#8220;Are you plumb sure of that dope, Lance?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance removed his arm from the corral rail, and
reached into his pocket. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you had
it in you, Al, to be that big a fool. But since
you&#8217;ve said it, here&#8217;s the dope. Take it, dad. I
said I&#8217;d turn it in, but I didn&#8217;t say who&#8217;d receive
it. The stock detective that&#8217;s been camping on
your trail for the last few weeks was killed on
the Lava Beds to-day. I found him. He&#8217;s at
Conley&#8217;s, now, waiting for the coroner. You
might ride over, Al, and see for yourself. And on
the way, you might ride up the Slide trail and take
a look around the Tooth. You&#8217;ll see signs where
he&#8217;s watched the ranch from up there. And you
can go on down and find where he camped several
times at Cottonwood Spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;The coroner won&#8217;t get on the job before to-morrow
or next day, and it will take a little time,
I suppose, for Brownlee&#8217;s employers to wake up
and wonder what became of the evidence he was
sent to collect. You&#8217;ll have, perhaps, a week in
which to make your getaway. They&#8217;re waiting
outside the Rim for the evidence this Burt Brownlee
was collecting, so that they could make one big
clean-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not setting myself up as a judge, or anything
like that&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;well, the going&#8217;s good,
right now. It may not be so good if you wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lighted a match and held it up so that Tom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
could glance at the maps and skim the contents of
the memorandum book. By the blaze of the match
Lance&#8217;s face still looked rather hard, determined
to see the thing through.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better burn that stuff, dad. And in the
morning&ndash;&ndash;how would it be if we went to town
and got the legal end of my new job straightened
out! I&#8217;ll want a Power of Attorney. You may be
gone for some time. I suppose you know,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;that Mary Hope and I are going to be
married. So you and Belle can take a trip somewhere.
They say it&#8217;s worth while going down to
the big cattle country in the Argentine&ndash;&ndash;South
America, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom did not reply. He had lighted a second
match and was studying attentively the data in
Burt Brownlee&#8217;s book. The third match told him
enough to convince him. He gave a snort when
darkness enveloped them again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sharpened my pencil pretty darn fine when
I made out my bill against the Black Rim a few
years ago&ndash;&ndash;and by the humpin&#8217; hyenas, these
figures here kinda go to show I overcharged &#8217;em.
Some. Not so damn much, either, if you look at
my side. Better get up the horses, Al, and you&#8217;n
the boys take the trail. The kid&#8217;s right. The goin&#8217;s
dern good, right now. Better&#8217;n what it will
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the scuffed sand before the corral gate Tom
made a small fire, with a few crumpled papers and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
one small book, which he tore apart and fed, leaf
by leaf, to the flames. The light showed him
grimly smiling, when he tilted his head and looked
up at Lance who watched him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;n the Douglas kid is figuring on getting
hitched! Well, don&#8217;t ever try to eye her down like
you done to yore dad. She&#8217;ll brain yuh, likely&ndash;&ndash;if
you wait long enough for her to make up her
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance laughed. Up at the house Belle heard
him and caught her breath. She stared hard at
the three forms silhouetted like Rembrandt figures
around the little fire, started toward them and
stopped. She was a wise woman, was Belle.
Some things a woman may know&ndash;&ndash;and hide the
knowledge deep in her heart, and in the hiding
help her mate.</p>
<p>Black Rim folk, who always knew so much of
their neighbors&#8217; affairs, once more talked and
chortled and surmised, and never came within a
mile of the truth. The young college rooster had
come home to the Devil&#8217;s Tooth, they gossiped,
and had a row with Al; so Al left home, and Duke
too. The Lorrigans always had been hard to get
along with, but that Lance&ndash;&ndash;he sure must be a
caution to cats, the way he&#8217;d cleaned off the ranch.</p>
<p>Marrying the Douglas girl, and taking that paralyzed
old lady right to the ranch, had probably had
a lot to do with it. Lance might be willing to forget
that old trouble with Scotty, but the rest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
Lorrigans sure never would. And it was queer,
too, how all that rustling talk petered out. Mebby
there hadn&#8217;t been much in it, after all.</p>
<p>Not even Mary Hope guessed why she and Lance
were left so completely in charge of the ranch.
Sometimes, when the invalid was captious and
showed too plainly that she preferred Belle&#8217;s
playing and singing to the musical efforts of her
own daughter, and scrawled impatient questions
about Belle&#8217;s return, Mary Hope would wonder
if Tom Lorrigan really hated her, and if her coming
had practically driven him out of his own home.
She would cry a little, then,&ndash;&ndash;unless Lance happened
to be somewhere near. If he were, there
was no crying for Mary Hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good son,&#8221; Mother Douglas once wrote,
&#8220;I wish Aleck was alive, to see how the Lord has
changed the Lorrigans.&#8221;</p>
